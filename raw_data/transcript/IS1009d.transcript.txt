well hi everyone again. um like before we uh i have to redo the meetings from n th the minutes from the last meeting and so here we go. uh it was discussed in the last meeting uh which was opened by the presentation from the interface um designer that uh looks would be very important on this new remote and um it is to send messages of course to the t_v_. it should have nine channel buttons, a next button, volume buttons, subtitle buttons, switch to control features, colour contrast, sharpness etcetera. it should have a memory switch, a mute button in case the telephone rings or something. uh speech recognition is one of her very f favourite personal uh features she would like see d d to be integrated in this um in this new remote. um. should be child friendly design with few buttons, colourful maybe with s star shaped or other shaped buttons. um she uh presented also an oversized remote which she guarantees nobody will ever be able to lose. um that's right. but uh her very f personal favourite really she, she would very much like to see a speech recogniser integrated in this remote. the industrial designer um presented her uh thoughts on the issue. she would like a special case made out of plastic that is very strong, not using any harmful materials, should be recyclable and should be colourful. should have an integrated circuit board that's highly sophisticated and temperature resistant. she would like to see a timer and or alarm facility integrated. uh technically this thing would also have a resistor and a capacitor, diode transistor, resonator, and if possible a rechargeable battery. uh and of course a circuit board. and how it would works, you press the button, the chip is morse morse code related relays the uh to the generat to the generator amplification and uh the circuit board is very inexpensive to build and so she thinks this is a great feature uh to to to consider. she would like uh this whole thing should be push buttons with a simple chip uh scrolling method is more expensive and not that practical anymore. should be battery operated and of course she would have the special cases. the marketing expert uh who has to finally come up with to to to market this product has been watching the competition, has done some research on the internet and also has used h her personal observations to come up with the fact that such a remote sh should be small, easy to use and it should be eye catching. from her point of view of course one of the most important facts is that we should get to market before our competition does. to do that uh maybe one or two features should be developed on which we could dwell on or in other words on which our campaign could be built on. too many new features or too many points would only confuse matter. so we prefer to have one or two features that can be really uh driven home. um it should have a fruit and vegetable design and should have a soft feel. she feels that's really what people want today. and the decision that we took last time was that uh the special feature we would like to see is a speech recogniser, the energy should be battery uh should be on a chip, should be trendy design, compact and strong, and should have buttons. and that concludes the presentation from the last minutes from the last meeting. now uh we are ready for the presentation of the prototype. mm-hmm. mm-hmm, mm-hmm. mm-hmm, mm-hmm. what kind of button? menu? uh menu th menu, uh one one. okay. mm-hmm. mm-hmm. yes the buttons are all raised, right? are raised, mm-hmm. right. or have two hands to operate it, yeah. yes, and it sort of sticks up so that you really you don't have to g first go like oh yeah here it's on and yeah, mm-hmm. so if you're left-handed or right-handed it doesn't matter. well, i have one question uh will there be anything written on the buttons, like that people know, or they have to learn that from a piece of paper which button does what? will have symbols so that that that the user really knows you know and doesn't have to first learn it yeah. but anyway it would ha i i i it has to have some kind of of symbols, text or something so that people kn that's right. okay, yeah just wanted make sure of that mm-hmm. right, mm-hmm. mm-hmm. right. now what, what are our special features for the marketing? that's really the voice recognition that's really unusual and then, and then the other thing would basically be sh shape or practicality of use. you know. colours. mm-hmm. cutest. yeah. okay, now uh having said that no, now this was our evaluation criteria which we uh just have done. now we're gonna talk about financing. well, there is a production evaluation. is that you? but that's after the financing. see? fi see? um. okay, we had looks and voice recognition. okay now on the financing we bring up the mm there it is. okay uh energy source we say that's battery, right? okay, now. so we i guess we use one. what? t cell or chart you are trying to change is protected. well, that's nice. she told me i could just ch change it here and then it would it doesn't work. hmm. oh, okay yeah, okay, let's see. okay, one, okay. oh go away. um kinetic source so that's in the energy source that's all we need. uh electronics, simple chip on print? is that's what we're using? one of those? come on. okay, one. uh regular chip on print. no. that's all we need, the one case, uncurved flat, single curved, double curved. double curved? one of those? case materi s supplements. plastic we said, right? uh wood, rubber? uh but, yes but that's just for the case material, so special colours though, we having that, right? and then we have to interface push buttons. scroll wheel, no. integrated scroll wheel, l_c_ display? button. no. uh, button supplement special colour? special form? and special material, rubber, wood, yes. okay. total seven point six whatever that means. that's the price. mm? eight, eight point two. that's hmm? eight point two, right? so, we looks like we are well within budget. okay. i guess i should save this i suppose, huh? oops. uh-huh huh huh. i just tried that. my documents, computer. my compu ah oh here it is, yes. okay, fine. save. okay good, so that's the good news. we gonna be popular. um. so that uh i think financing was pretty simple. now we would like to have a presentation by the marketing expert on production evaluation. you wanna go to the next slide? okay. um i just realised one thing. in the financing there was no room for our voice recogniser. and uh i don't know how we can evaluate that or how we can include that, too. eight, eight twenty, yes. i mean maximum we have another four point three euros i mean four thirty. but i mean we have no way of presenting that to management as you know as a f finished, as a finished product and saying okay with the voice recogniser that costs so much. so um we just have to beware of that. i mean and know whether the four thirty will really cover that. yeah. i'm sorry to interrupt then but i just uh recog i just remembered that there was no that that was not um included uh that there was no room for any special features, okay? so to beware of that. you wanna go to this next slide, marketing expert? i dunno. yes it is. mm-hmm. oh. why? wh why you need that up? i think you can make it there. yes i think uh shape is one. you you gave it a four. um, i dunno. i think i would give it at least a two. colour uh i one. i i like the colours. one. uh, i think i would give it a two. well it's also you can't really try it out uh the other things you have have more is are more tangible so from that point of view but um i'll give it a three. uh. here is what we looking at uh satisfaction on for example room for creativity. um. is there more room for creativity or are we absolutely happy? y um al always bearing in mind that right now we are of course well within the budget and that we still you know we probably can't, with this particular item, we probably can't just uh add a whole lot of more things. uh um we need uh you know we need to leave space money-wise for the voice recogniser. um. so th the question really is how do we feel with the project process? uh, um are we happy with the creativity that has passed here or we're not happy with the new product we created or that was created? uh i think personally i think uh i'm pretty happy. um an and then the next question is are we happy with the leadership of this project? uh and i think team work i think was very very good, i think we really yeah. mm-hmm. and uh i think we are we happy with the means we used? we used whiteboard, we didn't use digital p well digital pens i guess are these things. yes, we could. uh, it's maybe not in the best position in the room um you know like sometimes it's positioned so that it's much better visible for everybody and i think from that point of view we sort of ignored it a little bit. yes, i think so, i think absolutely, and fortunately we all had slides presentation which made it a little easier. um did we new did we find new ideas? i think we did. i think we we did, uh in more than one respect and uh so i think we did very well here. are the costs within budget? yes, yes. uh is the project evaluated? yes. um then celebration. so i i thank you all very much. um, i think this was very good and um i think we did come up with a new product that's uh feasible. feasible from the production point of view and feasible from a marketing point of view. so, thank you. i always get it on here, but getting it off is ah yes we have time later but we don't
hello. designer. yes. yeah. just the look like, the button part i'll explain. okay. now the um we decided upon including certain features on our remote. now these features includes the s um signal emitting uh signal it's the led or l_e_d_ the infrared. now uh we have included the switch on and off button. now we have included another feature that is the mute button on the side of the model. then we have included one to nine buttons for controlling the programmes the different channels. we have also included two buttons for increasing or decreasing the volume. and we have also included two buttons for scrolling up and scrolling down the programme channels. now our our model also contains a button which is called as the menu button. menu button. yes, menu at the centre we have included a button which is fluorescent green colour and this is the menu button which will control the colour, sharpness, brightness of this uh picture. we have also included a button which is called as the swapping button. now this is uh a special, special feature which we have included. now this button is an elongated shaped button and this is slightly flexible so if it is turned towards the right it will take to the previous channel, if it is turned towards the right it will take to the next channel. it will take the user to the previous and the next channel so this is a swapping button. no, swapping is if if example you're you're watching the second channel and then you go to the tenth channel and if you want to go back to the second channel you can swap, this button. yes. and at the end, it this remote has inbuilt voice recogniser which c which will recognise the user's voice and then it'll act accordingly. so this is our proposed model. now the marketing expert has to give her suggestion whether it'll be sellable or it'll be cost effective. yes, yes. yes. mm. abs okay. no, these the front buttons which are here, are the mute buttons. yes, yes. yes. pardon me? this is the menu yes, yes. a the the these these two are th to increase or decrease the volumes, and these two are to uh scroll the programme channels. scroll up or scroll down the channels. yes, it will have uh these buttons will have the numbers and all the rest of the buttons will have symbols. yes, which can be easily recognised. yes. yes. yes. yes. yes. yes. and and one more feature is we we have a holder for this remote which is an oyster shape. a shell shape. yes, yes. yes, snail shell. yes. mm-hmm. y yes yes. yes. yes. single curve? mm. plastic. is this for the case? yes. yes. yes. no. speci yes yes d we do have special form. one two three four five six seven eight nine nine points, okay, yes. okay. on the desktop. okay. fee selling. yes. okay. okay. yes. yes, yes. yeah mm. worse, okay. one. one. one. yes. i'll give three. two. we can always improve, yes. yes, features. yes. voices. yes. yes. and maybe yes. yes, yes you've done a good job. whiteboard more, yes, yes. yes. no. yes. cel celebration yes, yes. thank you. okay. they say it's forty minutes. okay.
hello. yeah. yeah. uh so this is our what uh we have made. this is a model of the remote control which we are going to build. uh this is us in a snail shape so uh it it is attractive um and it's it's blue in colour uh bright and uh it has yellow buttons and all the different colour buttons so it is a uh uh a looks-wise it is beautiful. uh and also compact in shape. uh um and also i it it will be easily fit into into the hands and you can access all the buttons easily. yeah, oops, sorry. um yeah and um uh the material which we are going to use for the case is uh plastic and uh w which which is s strong um uh and also uh for the um the material is plastic and uh for the buttons it is uh s soft rubber um and als yeah. yeah because uh uh you'll be touching the buttons more so it is soft when you touch it. and then um uh for the for the led, for the light emitting diode it is a fluorescent green and it's a a it is a bulb like an ordinary infrared. and and the button button's part uh will be explained by f francina. tell, yeah. mm-hmm. mm-hmm. hmm. mm-hmm. ah. yeah, definitely. yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah of course, and also hmm. yeah. yeah we can text. text that we can have on the case itself, we can it will be printed on the case and symbols as well as the buttons. yeah. yeah. so it is yeah, yeah shell. mm-hmm. mm. yeah, of course, yeah. mm. mm-hmm. mm. mm. mm-hmm. mm. yeah. yeah. mm-hmm. yeah, yeah. no. yeah. this is a yeah. yeah. i think uh that is uh f for rubbers that is uh yeah case material. mm-hmm. yeah. yeah. uh, i think that's the price. maybe it is it just n yeah. ami. ami should for yeah. mm-hmm. yeah. mm-hmm. mm. mm-hmm. mm-hmm. yeah. yeah. mm-hmm. yeah. yeah. eight twenty so we have um four euros, yeah yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah, yeah. yeah, still. yeah. included, yeah. hmm, hmm yeah, even my yeah, shape is one. yeah, even i think it is one. it's quite small. yeah, one. uh maybe two, yeah. uh three, mm-hmm. yeah. maybe we can yeah, include some more buttons and uh um yeah features. we can make the buttons few buttons smaller. uh i think they are quite big, so i think i i mean we can just have small buttons and more buttons in that case. if we want to have more features than that. yeah. yeah, definitely. mm-hmm. yeah, definitely, yeah, two mu mute buttons. hmm. mm-hmm. yeah. mm-hmm. even i'm happy. yeah. yeah, yeah, definitely. mm-hmm. yeah. yeah. yeah, probably. yeah. hmm. yeah, many. yeah. ah. yeah. yeah. thank you very much. do we do we have some time left? uh you have oh, alright.
hello mm-hmm. and she was challenged on that point okay. mm-hmm. mm-hmm. mm-hmm. mm-hmm. mm-hmm. mm-hmm. mm-hmm. good. you used to have all the buttons oh that's good, no, that's nice and friendly. mm-hmm. mm. mm-hmm. mm-hmm. mm-hmm. okay. yeah, okay, mm-hmm. mm-hmm. mm-hmm. mm-hmm. mm-hmm. mm-hmm. mm. menu button. mm-hmm. mm-hmm. of the screen. mm, mm-hmm. the next channel in the numeric pattern, or yeah, mm-hmm. mm. okay, okay. okay. mm-hmm. okay, well um what what i really like a lot about it is that you can reach the whole thing with one thumb, that you can really hold it in one h you don't need two hands and it's easily reachable even for somebody with a small hand, yeah? the buttons are all raised and if you hold it in the centre of your hand you can even reach it over here so you don't have to turn it around, turn it upside down, move it up, up and down, i really like that. you really did a good job on that, my little designers. um and um i like the idea that the on-off button is in a really prominent place. that's that's a really good good thing. yeah, that's great. mm-hmm. the colour's very attractive. um the um these buttons uh around here are the mute and these mm-hmm on both sides they're mute? so you can push either one? okay. and this brings the menu up on the screen? this brings the menu up on the screen and the orange ones are okay. f f okay. right, very good. uh it looks mm looks like something i can sell. okay and now i'm supposed to yeah. yeah. good point because we need the symbols 'cause we're going into an international market we can't have anything that's language dependent. symbols on it. mm-hmm, mm-hmm. mm-hmm. mm, 'kay, mm. mm-hmm. for the snail, yeah, mm-hmm, we have the snail shell. he goes right back into his shell. well you know i think we could do something really funny with this too because the snail is known to be slow and we could have some sort of little comic effect on our marketing about how this is a rapid snail or something like that you know that would, that would really work. so i think voice recognition is our big selling point 'cause nobody else seems to have that in in this price range. yep uh well i think that everybody's gonna say their remote control is practical. i think we have to, we have to dwell on on on the appearance. we're really gonna have the be the cutest remote control on the block. so i think we have to play with the image, play with the snail image um play with the visual and then the voice recognition. i think those are the two things to push. the look and the voice recognition. they're gonna be our two selling points. i'm supposed to make a little presentation, aren't i? okay. ah, but in my instructions i think it said i was supposed to go to the board and do something. no? yeah, that's me. oh, okay. sorry, sorry. mm-mm. that's right. can you just fill it in in the yellow boxes? or well. i guess it's double curved. mm-hmm. rubber, because we're gonna have the soft buttons. oh okay, the mm-hmm, mm' kay. mm-hmm. mm-hmm. no, 'cause we didn't put the clock in it after all, right? mm-hmm. yes. mm-hmm. yeah. mm-hmm. mm-hmm. okay, i'll take my file down so you can bring it up. 'kay should be able to get it now. 'kay, why don't you move just to the next slide right away. yeah right away. okay, well uh obviously my method for uh s m the marketing of this thing is first to ask the big question, will it sell? and i think we should show this prototype to people from various age and socio-economic groups and see about any fine tuning that maybe little things we haven't thought of. we can't accept every suggestion of course, but maybe we just need to get a few. and show the the prototype to consumer research groups, we don't s want somebody to suddenly come to us and tell us that this button is toxic and you know some child will swallow it and then we won't sell any. so we have to get some input from those people. and then after that we just have to go with our best intuition and you know we like it, we think it's good, we're gonna get behind it and sell it. um, next slide please. okay, now the things that i was thinking and th my wish list has really been realised in this prototype. i wanted the shape to be biomorphic, i didn't want anything with angles and all square, i wanted it to be comfy and roundy so we we've got that. the size is small, the colour's bright and warm which is what we wanted. we wanted the feel to be as soft as possible, we'll have the soft buttons and the way this is shaped, even though it's gonna be hard plastic, it feels good in your hand so that's nice. and functionality i put last on my list because people aren't going to use it before they buy it. so paradoxically the other features, in other words, the look, the feel um and the shape, that's what people are gonna get in the store. they don't have a television in the store, they can't play with it. um so they'll be our main selling points. so um th those have been fulfilled by your prototype and go ahead to the next slide please. okay, so um the shape um i think is a a one. that's really, really excellent shape. the size is small um and th these points are in the importance for the, for the marketing, these aren't i in how i feel. i think that it's i think that it's plenty small enough to sell but i think we're sort of right the scale is one to seven. i think we're sort of right in the middle as far as c other competitors. and our colour i think is great. the colours are bright and warm and we really do great job there. and given um the constraints that we had i think we got it as soft as possible. and then functionality um i think you did a really good job on functionality, obviously we could have ad added different functions but then we'd disturb something else so i would say that we got to a five out of seven on on functionality. so i think that basically we've got a great product and we can get off and running with it. yes. ah. well, um we had what, eight eight euros twenty as our cost? and so we've got we've still got four euros to go to spend. mm-hmm. well um that's mm-hmm. well as we know in today's technic technological world you can do just about anything at any price, the the the problem is quality. so we're just gonna have to settle for whatever quality that will buy us. and um it may not be the greatest quality but it may sell anyway. as we've seen with so many of these kinds of products. uh, well i isn't this my last slide? maybe. go ahead. i think that was my last slide, yeah. um. mm okay. and i'm supposed to present this scale on the whiteboard. um and we're supposed to talk about those things as a team now, so if you put my last slide back up there. i'm sorry i've um forgot to do that, um. hmm? well because i can't remember what i put on there. okay. now i'm supposed to see how long my leash is here. mm 'kay. you ready. so now we're all supposed to say what we think. um okay so on shape i gave it a one. wait what would you ra uh one being good and seven being the worst. um what do you think the shape is? one, okay, and be betsy? okay, uh-huh one, okay. and how about on size? on size i gave it a four, yeah, i feel it's just average. okay. mm-hmm. okay. okay you're the designer, of course you wanna give it a one. um and then how about how we doing on colour? colour, i gave it a one. i really like all those nice bright, warm colours. one. one, one, one, okay. and how about the feel? taking into um consideration texture and comfort in the hand. okay, i gave it a three, two, yeah? three. two, okay. and the next is functionality where i i admit i was a little hard on our team here, but yeah. mm-hmm. okay. two, okay. three? okay. well, um. it looks like we've got got ourselves a pretty good product. um the functionality's the only place where maybe we have to think about m m maybe, heaven forbid, having another meeting. but um otherwise i think we're we're ready to go to go with this product. anybody else have any other comments or any other things that we feel we should evaluate? mm-hmm. well then again if we're gonna um do the speech recognition thing we're gon there gonna be some buttons that are gonna have to be added for that for the recording of the the speech. so that that's where we're gonna have to do maybe we can eliminate one of the mute buttons, instead of having two mute buttons. and um then maybe we can do something with the um the volume control. maybe we can put that all on one button. um and a couple of other th maybe comp uh consolidate some of the usage an and see what we can do with that. mm-hmm. no. mm-hmm. mm-hmm. i'm pretty happy with it too, yeah um, it's something i think i can market. yeah. i think you've done a good job, miss leader. yeah i d i do too i think we worked well together as a team, yeah. mm-hmm. yeah maybe we could've used the whiteboard a little bit more, yeah, we didn't use that enough. mm-hmm. and we used the slide because it was better positioned. mm i think that's true mm-hmm. mm-hmm. i think we were we were very good, yeah, mm. mm-hmm. okay. yes, yes. celebration. today we have apple juice and after we sell m million of 'em we have champagne. mm-hmm. mm-hmm. mm-hmm. okay. okay. watch i i have my cord behind you here. okay. but we we were told we could end the final meeting at any time, whenever we felt we were finished. it'll take me the rest of the time to get my microphone out from my necklace. oh, there we go.
