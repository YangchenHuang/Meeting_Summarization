okay. uh first of all i'll start with the costs, because that's going to influence our design. if you don't know if you al already had a look or not? because we have a problem. if you look closely, you can see. um i already took the liberty to make some suggestions... at the moment we have fifteen buttons, one l_c_d_ screen, one advanced chip-on-print. we use a uh sensor, that's for the speech. uh we use kinetic energy. and we wanted uh the buttons in a special colour. okay. what's the first thing we should drop? the special colour of the buttons? okay. uh should we switch to a hand dynamo? uh that's the still the same idea as the kinetic energy because you have to use it and do things. batteries? batteries.. yeah. so you're going to redesign something. okay, so we're at twenty five. um do we keep the shape doubly curved or g do we go for single curved? mm-hmm. uh yeah. um uh another option i saw was to drop the buttons one through nine, so you can't directly access a channel, but instead use only the up and down arrows. that would skip nine buttons and four and a half euros. yeah? uh then we have left uh yeah. we do. they don't need special colours. fine. that's more like it. you were saying something. yeah. mm-hmm. yeah. yeah, some more menu options. yeah. okay so maybe we can drop few more buttons. but um now let's look. mm-hmm. uh yeah, scroll-wheel, push-button uh yeah. yeah. mm-hmm. mm-hmm. mm-hmm. yeah. yeah. uh yeah. yeah. it's uh one integrated button is five times the cost of a normal button. so you could also drop j three more of these, without losing much functionality. you just drop the okay and the back. oh, that's for the speech. yeah. s s drop speech recognition? yeah that's possible. buttons. that's not very easy to use. yep. okay. because if you d lose the l_c_d_ screen, we need a lot of yeah. we need a lot of extra buttons. okay so we drop the speech. and drop it yeah? okay. s fo four less euros. so we still have three and a half euro to lose. yeah if you lose the the back, the okay button uh v let's say we only have the four arrows, and the menu button. then you're oh and the power button we have also. yeah. so that's one euro. yeah. yeah? and that would save zero point two euros compared to no. yeah. to this together is more expensive than oof, it's almost the same as t keeping this. and we can drop these two. volume. and the power button. that's the basic. yep. okay th that's yeah that's one euro more expensive. that's not an option. menu, power. four arrows? power. uh yeah. okay. so four arrows? uh power i believe? uh we have a back and a okay button. and the menu. yeah, and even if we drop three buttons from here, we still have to make some adjustments around here. so the l_c_d_? yeah. then i rather make it wood. because then also it's good in the market with the forty five plus uh people. no that maybe not. but maybe it's better than plastic anyway. yeah? yeah okay uh yep. yeah, yeah. yeah, okay. plastic. uh that's easy because plastic is free. yeah, okay. uh if we dropped uh yeah? you still need that. s no, i keep the re yeah. yeah. because we already designed for it. so yeah and something else. no y you would rec then you have then you still need two additional buttons i believe. for the volume. you can use those yeah. oh yeah and power. that's three buttons and this would cost yeah. three. up, down, okay. yeah, okay. it would save enough yeah you can choose this, drop these, then we have a half euro left. so we can maybe still use power button. yeah. yeah. you see? oh still yeah? oh then i miscalculated. oh yeah. shit. drop the special colour. 'kay. what else? uncurved? yeah. they made it very easy for us. ah, i don't think i can s uh persuade the management to say, this is better for the market so you sell more than buttons. that's oh yeah since we only have one button. i just m i don't i think uh yeah it's i think it's grey, regular. grey and rubber. of plastic. yeah. yeah. no i don't think the current status of uh chips are pretty uh energy conserving, no. yeah hand dynamo? do you want an extra button? yep? instead of an additional power button? yeah? it's for scroll without yeah but it's just a scroll-wheel which you can push down. so yeah? so woah we're within budget. it's a miracle. yeah? okay. um, well. 'kay, this was old. yeah back to work. uh did i save it? yeah. i i wanted to go, but i wasn't allowed. so uh i just forgot to save this. just a minute.. yeah, this the last phase of course, so hmm. oh. okay. um well we first should have had a uh prototype presentation. but well as you saw that hadn't made no sense, because we had to drop it. uh yeah. yeah it was more important, so i just pushed up the agenda. uh, evaluation criteria. you have t produced something about that? uh you put it in the. yeah. f_ five. alt up freaky. yeah. uh, of course we dropped a little bit of those uh mm-hmm. two. uh y we should fill this in now. yeah okay. uh yeah in the new design i s would say it's three. but now, in original design i say two. okay then i say three. hey, you're marketing, eh. hmm. m maybe underline. red. oh yeah very true. he types everything. everything. you don't use anything else. yeah. yeah okay. yeah. mm-hmm. nope. uh check with the excel sheet. yeah integrate it. yeah. just go scrolling and it will activate. it shows the most used functions and they are relevant, but you say you double click on the no, not anymore. because he's now have a scroll-wheel that you can push in. like on the the mouse. yeah. to get into menu. yeah. or hold it ten seconds. no no no. uh it should be trendy. yeah. four. yeah, im in the menu. five. it's the weirdest remote control i've ever seen. so well it's different. yeah. yeah, it's still yeah, i say two. oh, that's the next. two. yeah definitely. you still have rubber d or no. yeah. yeah. the one button we have. yeah you could check with the excel sheet. yeah. yeah or three. we have something. new. yeah. you like both. um oh yeah. i just couldn't um, just one minute.. so. no not anymore. yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah well yeah. no yeah okay. so ooh. and yeah? what? yeah. yeah. that count them. add them? or could somebody start calculator? mm-hmm. yeah, yeah. you have to 'kay. so four and nice work. o one. plus five. bo uh two. four. start over? you can oh yeah. okay. three, four, nine. uh eleven, fifteen. seventeen. s uh that was the last one. that was that. yeah. so divided by nine. so yeah. divided by nine. so thr t two. so we're better than average. no. things, yeah. okay. it's still yeah. has some shortcomings. okay so um this we had, this we had. we have to do a product evaluation. uh prototype presentation we dropped. so uh the finance we looked. we have redesigned. uh not on that, but so you can just make one big l_c_d_ screen. yeah uh the the button has a special colour, the frame has a special colour. it's plastic. and single curved. oh and you might want to add a uh infrared led. otherwise it uh doesn't function uh so well. well i have to um um make an uh report of every decision we made so far. and i try to get chip just before uh i uh receive the excel sheet. so i yeah i'm i'm somewhere, but maybe you can help me. uh i was here. so ah that's enough to get started with, so uh, i just took one for every step and then a conclusion. yeah. well i think i have to make a p an issue called finance. yeah. mm-hmm. .... i don't think so, if you see the options. but yeah. you can't even draw anymore. even children can draw. can you just push pen and then keep on hmm. yeah. yeah just on the the m um the l_c_d_ display. this is your real remote. yeah. yeah. you can just reuse that, because the name is the same. initials. mm. luckily. yeah, it's uh yeah. okay. and copy this. just a minute. it's it's somewhere i d it isn't inside. yeah, and don't know how it's or eject it. from up there? no. yeah it's somewhere in here. save copy. yeah.. yes.. well um now you probably have to recalibrate. oh, five minutes to the end of the meeting. and the recalibration is done using this icon here. yeah well i just okay. you go ahead. yeah. yeah. then i have to uh uh write this, and i don't know if you have to present, because i didn't receive any information about that so far. maybe we get a a final mail. yeah. yeah, i have still ten minutes to finish the report. yeah. and you can uh just uh relax and uh have cup of coffee or oh no, they don't have beer here so you can't celebrate. you can just if you ma finish my presentation please. uh over there. the presentation is still open. so if you finish that then you'll see uh yeah next. oh yeah, we have to do the project uh evaluation. just uh do that quickly. uh uh well basically what that says, we discuss it and um so how were did the project process uh go? did you, were you all pleased with the process as it was? or are there uh yeah the interaction and the steps we followed, and and so forth. yeah. mm-hmm.. mm-hmm. mm-hmm. okay and was that due to my leadership? yeah? that okay? okay. um was there uh enough room for creativity? so and the uh about the board digital pen? uh was that helpful or ooh. yeah it works. mm-hmm. use the pen. yeah yeah. blink. oh. okay, are are there any new ideas about this? all i think i didn't really receive, yeah. uh uh w uh s sorry uh mm-hmm. yeah. oh. uh we should uh enter our questionnaire. ah. woah. okay. uh okay. that's the management. hope so. um
oh no. no n i i already did it. it's not much. it's just one question. yeah. no that's that's for the trendy uh feel and look. so yeah, b but i think the battery option. oh. oh no. yeah. but we don't have any basic options any more. yeah we c could we only need the the the the the menu arrow arrow button uh thing. everything you can do with with the menu. so with the display. yeah. so you do one inte you can do one integrated scroll-wheel push-button. and then just drop all the other buttons. but but th the cost of one integrated button is far more than a few extra push-buttons. yeah. so we have to to make it s uh more uh it has to be could drop the speech recognition. we we d yeah. yeah. we lose our whole concept. uh so no we just we keep the l_c_d_. yeah. if we do uh two integrated scroll-wheel push-buttons, we can drop all the the push-buttons. with with one uh integrated button we can uh do the whole menu thing. with the other, we can do the the channel, the volume, et cetera. no it's three euros. no? um no it's it's n yeah. yeah yeah yeah. it's the let's make the let's make the case plastic. yeah. but plastic with a with a special colour. a woo wood uh wood uh wood colour. that's an option. yeah. so we do one one s yeah. hmm. no the buttons, those are really needed. yeah th th it's it's uh an advanced chip-on-print. oh that but the but the integrated uh button? how many func functions can it uh have? okay. oh no. no no, it has to be um curved. okay. okay. wh what we could do is um drop the the special colour, and uh do the special colour for the buttons. yeah. just something else than than black or white i think. yeah. the display the but if you have to power the for ten minutes, then the yeah. no no it has to be curved. yeah. just put a special special colour of the buttons, or something. yeah or spe special form? yeah. yeah. but it's it's for the integrated button, i think also. or yeah. okay. yeah. yep. oh just oh ma make it two special colours, but we only have one button. okay. yeah. okay. yep. two or three. two or three. yeah. yeah. or give it a colour. yeah true one. yeah. it hides uh basic functions. yeah true. i think we are it's in oh yeah it was integrateds. yeah. can you uh change channels directly with with just one button? no, you have to scroll through the menu, before yeah. so it's it's not no. yeah. oh no. seven. yeah. five. five. yep. yeah. i think a two. no. yep. no you got a plastic. yeah. yeah. you only have one yeah. four. yeah. red. mm yeah yeah. it's the white part uh yeah. we have a we have a mm-hmm. ah i and that you only have to control one button. it gives visual feedback. so i think a five. five. okay. yeah. yeah that looks uh great. yeah. nah yep. yeah. s yep. wow. no we put the electronics into the fashion. yeah, four is okay. okay. three plus? plus one. plus five? oh. wait a second. oh. it's it's gone wrong. okay. it's your turn. no it's if you press twice on the plus button, then you get s s no. that's why it's uh just count it to yeah. sixteen. twenty two. twenty four. twenty six. oh, sorry.. oh my. okay. twenty eight. hmm. some questions are yeah. oh yeah. yeah. yeah. oh great. okay it's your turn now. yeah. yeah we we can just uh use this one. and then uh over-paint it with uh uh the green uh he only needs one button. yeah. or we have to delete this one or oh oh no. okay. so that's okay, but how do we make the the scroll uh button? it's just one yeah. uh that's the infrared uh thing. yeah. yeah. yeah. um, uh it's just a scroll yeah, is it's horizontal or vertical? i think yeah. yeah, yeah. yes. it doesn't look like uh uh it it's it's not yeah. it's not very fashionable anymore. but uh it's okay. yeah. maybe m make it bigger? or yeah. that looks little bit more uh maybe that's a s a special colour for it. so we can make it uh special? or or speckles in it? i dunno. uh i'm not sure. yeah red is already a special colour, i think. so it's not very special, but uh yeah. just uh put the purple uh purple on it. that's trendy. woah. oh yeah. hmm. oh what?? oh no. no no. yeah. oh it's it's just one computer? or no. but can we delete it, just with delete? or crashed. oh, no. okay. yeah, over here. hmm? what's this? oh yeah. oh that's the select button. it's uh no, it looks it's okay. specially the the r_. d designed by okay. no. do they have a lo oh, the here. this i this is the logo. two r_s and a one. yeah. okay. are we uh ready? uh or is this uh the last assignment? or final um bug. bug. no it's in inside the no it oh. hey, you've got it uh read only. so you have to uh. it's too uh it is it's now single curved. so it's flat. oh no. okay. it doesn't matter. it's it's that's the detector uh for the okay. yeah. i don't know. maybe that's why it's it's not working, because it's more yeah. oh. oh yeah. yeah. you've to make it s uh ninety degrees. you have oh we're always long. yeah, can we t can we get to that i oh it's not working anymore. oh yeah yeah yeah yeah, it's it's working, it's working. yeah. we're improving uh yeah. yeah. no it so cake. no. no. yeah. yeah. especially after the first meeting. and yeah. yeah yeah yeah. yeah. yeah but only the the financial parts uh yeah. yeah. finish meeting. i think the powerpoint is is too limited. you can't uh draw easy in in powerpoint. it has to be uh yeah. the drawing board has to be integrated into powerpoint, so that you can just easily yeah. yeah just for text, for text it's uh it's okay. but 'kay. okay. oh. okay.
did you do your questionnaire already? uh it wants yeah but everything is. just a normal battery then, yeah. oh my goodness. well i guess i we'll have to go for single curve then. i mean we have to drop on everything. yeah. how about sorry. that's what i was thinking. a a and uh 'cause then they don't have to n they don't need special colour as well. that was exactly my point. like let's drop all the buttons, and just make one i mean we're gonna use the l_c_d_ screen anyway. so we'll just have to use it for everything. and then you can make an overview of channels in the screen, and select a channel, click yeah we need one integrated button for everything then. yeah. kind of. i was because yeah. if you if you go to if you go to our uh view, like you if you are in the sound system there, uh and you wanna adjust the treble for instance, this is just uh an example, y y you wanna see a bar on which you can adjust it from zero to ten for example. but you want a sound preview of how it's gonna sound, right? so you wanna click on it, activate it, whe and when you move it, hear the difference of the treble coming out or going into the sound. so you'll you'll need a a kind of a joystick uh button. yeah. exactly. yeah it's r yeah. no. no but yeah it's it's expensive, but uh we never considered the possibilities of uh speech recognition. 'cause it can take the function of a lot of uh uh buttons. i no. yeah but lets just say that the speech recognition works. we uh we we haven't really integrated this the speech into the system, so we can might as well s drop that. we need to lose some buttons. which that's even yeah, if you if you go to eight i don't know how to yeah, we need the chip for the for the l_c_ display. yeah. true. oh. hmm. yeah uh you uh uh yeah. so the other option would be to go for the the sample speaker, and which can use a regular chip, wh which is six euros in total. that doesn't matter. well yeah. exactly. yeah but the uh can't we f uh fit all the buttons in an intreg integrated scroll push-button? 'cause that will save us one and a half euro already. and then if w th then we have to scroll through a lot of menus to be able to get where you want, huh? and uh yeah d at l yeah. at least one for power. oh. yeah it's just as expensive as what we have now. yeah endlessly. i mean it can be a power button as soon as it powered on. you can go into you in you main menu, you can choose uh flip channel, uh you can choose sound options, any options. yeah. maybe we should. 'cause we don't have money and w we want the screen. i guess we have to. we'll we'll be on yeah it says right here. yeah. but we definitely want the thing to be a special colour though. damn. yeah and then yeah yeah yeah yeah. well, you only have to power it up when you wanna use it. i don't know.. yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah. that's the most import we only have yeah but well we come back to the drawing board then, huh? it's silly 'cause we we should have had this meeting before we start drawing. oh yeah? okay. drop everything. yeah. we went straight into finance? for yeah. yeah. mm-hmm. i think it does. because the operating behaviour of the young user was also defined in colour and shape and the use of l_c_d_, right? yeah. well, we have extended menus, on the on the l_c_d_ screen. so i no. yeah. yeah alright. yeah yeah. definitely one. it has to be. you're not gonna find them. yeah the next not so much so. yeah. yeah it's uh it's integrated. e exactly just like a m mobile.. well uh we should b build it so that if you don't kind of push into the menu or something, if when it's on, yeah, it's turned on, it automatically has the the programme and the volume function, but as soon as you click it you go into the menu or some of you or you double click it. no because it has four arrows, right? oh yeah. yeah i was thinking still about our uh integrated joystick. say. yeah that is a bummer. we'll make it a morse code. yeah. yeah i would go for five or six, yeah. okay five. let's not diss our remote. yep. just one button. but uh yep. we still have the fruit and vegetable print. fr oh i mean the oh never mind. i'm a bit lost.. it's way more practical, yeah. yeah. yeah. so we still uh we still have the primary colours. but only on the on the outside, not on the button. yeah? okay. yeah. yeah still we we dropped also on the the double uh curve. and and colour. yeah. s yeah. uh actually we d we didn't do so well on this one. because it's basically an old one, uh with little curve on the side, and in a different colour. still, it's still hard. i mean the sponge-like and the three d_ shape, that would give it something young and fresh. of course. yeah but it be because uh we couldn't hardly draw on the b s on the lower half of the screen, we could not make it big enough to actually draw in the so i mean i wanted to put digits on the buttons as well. but hell yeah. if we have only one button. and even the shape we have now uh simulates kind of an r_ and the reversed r_, doesn't it? so no. the only e the only thing easy about it is that you don't have to move your fingers. 'cause it has only one button. yeah exactly. i would say six. it's really not easy to use. 'cause you're putting everything most votes count. um definitely in casing, 'cause we have a hard plastic yeah. yeah because the the batteries, those thingies last forever. and the the casing, hard plastic also lasts forever. so i would go for one. okay yeah. oh. no m i would g i would go for four. because we kind of tried to but we kind of failed with the budget that we have. yeah. yeah. yeah yeah. that's it. ah we can do the math. uh yeah. did you make this questionnaire or what? oh. i wouldn't be able to do it that fast. f pretty difficult. just type in the digits. they're all one digit numbers right? and then you can count them together. eleven. fifteen. sixteen. seventeen. oh what? how hard is this? never mind. twenty four. twenty eight. twenty eight. yeah the lower the the lower the score the better, right? yeah but but i are you sure we this number actually tells us somethings? i don't think so because some questions are related to positive issues and some to negative. so if you give a true to a positive, it actually means that the low the lower the better. but if you give true to a negative question no? durable, that's good. easy to use. yeah.. also good. yeah okay. i guess you did do it. oh yeah yeah. no okay. okay. yeah true. yeah definitely definitely. because now it's just an average it's remote. yeah okay because of the l_c_d_ screen. but uh it looks and stuff, it still uh it's not, it's not really eye-catching, except for the colour. yeah. product evaluation. shall we try? black. okay uh we're still gonna go for the fancy colours? but are we gonna stick with the green or are we gonna do blue? one scroll button and for what? should give it some time? yay. have to take this away also. and this um oh yeah, of course. um pen yeah? format. current colour red. oh yeah we did our special colour for the line widths, now that's a ten. it's gonna be one str scroll. horizontal's easier too, 'cause you can is it more natural than this? so let's say whoops. 'kay. basically. it's really ugly. oh what do you mean? like a other colour than this one? yeah can we do it uh uh can we do a print? i think we have to choose, yeah? okay special colour. we do have special colour. does it mean uh that shall we just give it some dots to make it look pretty? purdy. purple? yeah yeah. oh no my remote has acne. no. that's why we have that button. it's so cute. doh. is that that? how the we did we do that? we can try. that doesn't respond also to the undo. it looks like it's no, where do you want some more dots? okay, it's not the prettiest, i know. it's not so random huh? yeah okay. we can make a l a logo. like uh put it like the shape. something like that. i mean it's not too uh that's not their logo, is it? yeah. it's a how shall we do the logo in black or not? are you dissing my drawing? this one? it looks like a ribbon. so who wants to draw? this is actually quite fun. do we need to do anything? i hear you people are typing. oh, okay. it's almost four. at four, yeah,? this is really bizarre. it looks like there's a it looks like a butterfly. no, but it i it's not a bu a beamer. b it's a normal t_v_ screen, kind of thing. oh. yeah there is some kind of projection i think. with a with a mirror, huh? or something. yeah. so are we gonna change anything to this? i mean is it gonna this is gonna be flat. yeah exactly. yeah. yeah. and this is also gonna be nope. but sometimes then uh all of a sudden it does work. maybe no it's i think you only need two points. or not. no, you sh slanted yeah. yeah. well maybe. yeah it it matters for the aim of this thing. yeah. yeah it's only a bit like to that side, but that is that one by the way. 'cause this one makes the angle either like this. so i if i change this, it will go there, if i change that, will go there. mm-hmm. i will take this away 'cause it looks messy. maybe we will. what's this anyway? it looks like candle wax. uh th uh do you mean the the interaction between us? or yeah well at first i was really stressed. because it went a bit fast. but then as i knew the tempo that i had to be on, the second time i think i did a bit better. and the third time yeah, i mean yeah, yeah yeah yeah. yeah we mm-hmm. yeah. definitely. well you did become more assertive the the second time round, so that yeah. you were more in charge kind of thing. i guess so. i mean i we were pretty democratic. yeah. maybe yeah. it's uh it's the the pen is more intuitive, 'cause we're all used to writing with pen. and uh as i said, uh i uh have no idea how powerpoint works, so will take me half a day to be able to make a normal powerpoint presentation. but once i get to know the program probably, i mean, it looks better, you know. or uh something like that. you can give it a kind of a home style, like we have i the the logo and everything. and i don't know. yeah the the the problem with powerpoint for me is that you have to i put in the pre-made chunks c as well. you know, you can draw something on the sketch-board and then take it there, or whatever. alright. alright. well, s see you in a second huh?. yeah we have to pull it this way, huh? wait.
. oh,. no. oh. no. yeah but young people like that. so just do normal battery. yeah. it has to be twelve and a half. or not? uh, yeah. but we can keep it single curved with uh top view still curved, but from the side it's it's flat, and the screen screen is just well you just have to hold it like this then. so alright. let's do it then. yeah. we f_ eight. yeah. the joystick. integrated scroll-wheel push-button, yeah. yeah or or the integrated scroll-wheel push-button. so that's kind of on your mouse and then you can click it, adjust it, click again and then you're out of it. but you still but you then still need to have well you can use the scroll-wheel as well for um maybe for the channels. but you still um you still have to have some some button in the menu to go back. yeah. well not all. not s not sound i guess. mm. yeah. wh wh what what what is the what is the uh sample sensor sample speaker? speech recognition. right. buttons. no, it can be disturbed by by noise and stuff like that. let let let me see what's more what's more popular. i guess the the screen was more popular than um than the speech recognition. i have to look on that. let me see. uh well no i was wrong. there are more people who like speech recognition than an l_c_d_ screen. but if it but it it it's a it's a both a hypers no, but well we yeah we keep the screen. i mean it's it's about the same. eight one to ninety one percent, uh sixty six to seventy six. yeah. let's drop the speech. sixteen euros. but y y yeah. yeah. and then and then use um the the okay. and the menu button does also does the okay function then. and then when you in the menu s so so you activate the menu. yeah yeah. yeah.. well okay. for example if you have f f four buttons, channel up and down, uh volume left right okay, i've i think we have to keep that. and then and the power button. so that's five. that's basic. that that's what you need anyway. and then for the menu, um you can have a button that activates menu. or d or do we just integrate an an an scroll-wheel with a push-button. and then if the moment you use the scroll-wheel, the the the menu gets activated, and then you can scroll, choose an option, click on it, it goes into an feature. click on it again, selects features, scroll, adjust it. click again, it's okay. then you only need one button to move back. or or under each option, you set a you set an a screen thing what says back, and you select that one, click again, and you go one step back. and in that menu, scroll, click, one step back. so that then you need five buttons, and one integrated scroll-wheel push-button. but we can't drop three buttons. but i see that's yeah. so that's not a good idea. because which buttons do we have now? those five which i mentioned, and then menu, and then yeah. f of the four things? yeah, th power. which more? yeah. power. th yeah that's five. yeah, okay that's seven, and one to activate the menu, yeah. so okay that's eight. well we can't reduce that. we we keep the display. oh, well okay. yeah. yeah well we need the advanced instead of r yeah but but that's not our market. ah no, hard plastic. yeah, plastic with special colour. no but i i because we have to use the special colour anyway. you forgot that. so let's go for the plastic. and since it's not kinetic, it doesn't have to flip around that much? we still have problem of two euros. yeah we can't drop them. do we really need that advanced chip for an l_c_d_ display? oh. i rather keep i rather keep the display. so the only option is an hand dynamo. oh no tha oh that's one euro, right. and then integrated s yeah but that would make it not so easy to use. i mean it's not that important, easy to use, but yeah. you you press it for like three seconds. then then then you should do everything in the menu. on the screen. yeah. yeah, but we'd alright. it s it saves us four euros and it costs us two and a half. so let's see, we we drop the price by one and a half. but we still have thirteen left. thirteen. so still half. there goes the special co well that would make it less appealing. so that's no option. we sure about the advanced chip we need for the display? well yeah. yeah. we made it hard for ourselves with the display, but it's a cool feature. yeah but i mean what is meant by special colour? s yeah. alright. yeah. so i rather have an hand dynamo than than drop the colour. you can still play with it then i guess. i don't know. yeah, but a hand dynamo costs a lot of energy to keep the screen working. so i guess that isn't an option. yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah true. let's let's go for the hand dynamo then. or or do we or do we do uncurved and flat? instead of yeah it has to be curved and has to have that colour. and a screen. yeah. s what what is special f oh yeah, special form. maybe that's nicer. but we don't have any buttons. so do d uh make it a special colour then. yeah ma make it a special colour then. okay. make it a special colour and then it look fancy. so yeah. let's let's save it. yeah. let's do it like this, i mean, because it does not lose our identity of the product as we yeah all your designs are uh pretty much yeah but that but that's the fun part of it. alright. yeah what's the next uh phase? uh the agenda. by your humble p_m_. oh f frustrated. alright. yeah. drop, yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah that that's yeah. i uh i sure did. and it combines with product evaluation. uh so we all have to keep in mind what has changed now. so what we have left on the because evaluation is based on the initial uh user requirements. alright. let's make it big. um well we evaluate uh the design with a seven point scale, as following. well the remote controls according criteria blah blah blah. true or false, and then on a scale of seven points, a scale, as we all know it. um well the criteria are based on the user requirements, uh the trends from the marketing research, and the marketing strategy of the company itself. um well they are in a word document, which i will open now. yeah. i don't know it's open yet. no. and we all have to uh agree on a certain level. what's this? oh. i don't know. um well the first point is the remote control matches the operating behaviour of the young user. so that means the operating behaviour was using quite a lot of functions. how do you think about that? yeah the us u it it it's it's mainly con mainly concentrating on a lot of functions, in this question. so do you think yeah. you can you can ma yeah, you can make a lot of extended menus. that's true. i mean the the possibilities are almost unlimited, to to build in menus in the screen. so on a scale from one to seven, what do you think? huh? two or three? something like that? well we have to choose one. so uh what do you say? i agree on two. yeah. i uh i say two, personally. but yeah well we have to evaluate i guess what we have now. yeah? you say three, and you you said al also three? three? okay well i say still two, but it has to be three then. yeah i know. so it's made bold. but it's nah, it's not very clear on the sc maybe other colour, yeah. that's better. uh yeah. alright. oh, it doesn't have to be bold anymore. alright. yeah. um well the remote control has wha the remote control has irrelevant or less used functions. for example audio settings and screen settings. yeah. well, yeah. so it it's a very true point. i mean it hides all those function. but, i mean uh they're hidden in the screen. if you don't want to use them, you don't s you s just scroll over them. and you place them f i don't know where. so that's very true, i guess, for our case. uh the second point. it shows the relevant and most used functions. power button. do we ha still have a power button? well yeah the button's integrated, huh? yeah we dropped it. you j you just push it in for yeah just just push it in for th for three seconds or something, and then yeah. i don't know. yeah. um it shows the relevant and most used functions. yeah uh on the other uh on one side i would say yes, and the other side i would say no. so it's i don't know. yeah. with the scroll butt yeah and then say channel. and then hmm? yeah. yeah. but but how do you change from volume to channel? no. no we have n we have no buttons left. so the joystick was not an option. so so you hav so you you have to double-click, i mean, for, i mean, uh volume, and three double click for the menu, or something. yeah. yeah. yeah. alright. but but ease of use was not very important, may i remind you. so that's yeah but that that's not a question. uh the remote control shows the relevant and most used functions. well i think it's pretty much in the middle. you have to search for them in in the in the s in the screen, in the menu. so so maybe it's more like a f a five. or yeah. five or six? five? alright. yeah. oh. yeah. yeah. alright. uh the the remote control makes use of technolog technological innovation like l_c_d_ screen and speech recognition. well yeah but we dropped the speech recognition. but it has at least one innovation. i say two then. yeah but that that's not that's not this question. uh thi uh that's the other question. this one. two yeah. i think l_c_d_'s more useful than speech what? oh not the bold one. right. okay, it has a fancy look and feel by using fruit and vegetable prints, primary colours and sponge-like material. it should have been two questions. i realise now, because sponge-like material is dropped. but the look and feel yeah. the button has also colour. yeah. yeah. the one. mm mm. yeah we have single curve now, and no and no material. so maybe in the middle or something. yeah, i mean it's worth the yeah. yeah. yeah. but then we would have to drop the screen. oh red. yeah. yeah. i like bold. uh the remote control displays the corporate logo. yeah. you just have to draw it. yeah. but there's uh enough space for the corporate logo. i mean, if there's only one thing. yeah. so i will say that is very true. yeah. the remote control is easy to use. well i would say skill, uh i would say six, or something. i don't think it's easy to use, or not so. yeah. yeah. it it it has a nice screen. but yeah. yeah. well i i would say a five or a six. what do you say? easy to use? five or a six? so a six, more. yeah, uh i would go for the six too. so um well, another question, uh the remote control is durable. i don't know if that's the correct word. but uh in use, both battery as casing? yeah? true, true. and the casing is plastic,? yeah. if you don't drop it too much, it's uh should last pretty long. yeah? but uh i think rubber compared is better. so i think a two is more appropriate than yeah. logo. okay i will go go for two. uh the last one? the remote control's a good example for company's motto, we put the fashion in electronics. uh turn around. yeah. but um yeah? it's not yeah, true. so a four. it's it g it g goes, it's not the best we could do, i guess. but it all has to do with the budget, because it's it's not the bad idea we had, so alright, yeah. right. so if i understood it right, we have to count these numbers. uh yeah. mm-hmm. oh oh alright. word document, the yeah we have to count them. uh yeah just add them and then uh divide them. yeah. mm. i all made it po i i all made it i all made it possible uh for a positive questions, so we can count it. i mean if you have reversed question, you have to reverse the scale, uh yes. yeah. thanks. oh easy. question number four, yeah? yeah. how hard is it? yeah just use oh there tho uh there's no n there's no num pads. it's a it's a bit uh yeah. i think you can just count them by a um let's move over. three, plus one, four. nine. uh, yeah. are you here? eleven. fifteen. sixteen, yeah. no sixteen. uh sixteen plus six. twenty two. twenty two, yeah? tw twenty twenty eight. twen uh okay. by nine. that's uh three uh or le less than a three. yeah. twenty eight di divided by nine makes three point one one one one one one one. yeah. yeah, but there are no negative questions i guess. good example. durable use. easy to use. this is good. fancy look and feel, that's good. technology innovation was good, because of a marketing uh requirement. re relevant most used function. and hides these functions. that was also a good thing. and then matches the opera of the user was also a good thing. so it were all positive questions, by uh by purpose. so yes, so the it tells us something, yes. becau but the picture would be a lot different if we didn't have to drop those uh those things, i guess. yeah. nah it it's it's better than average, but yeah. so th yeah. no. the colour and the screen. yeah we we have to maybe if we have to redesign it on this with some casing around it, yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah. oh yeah. yeah. do we have to do other things? or just redesign? alright. yeah. so you made a start, right? yeah. alright. the the target group has a weak spot for fruit and vegetables, like primary colours, spongy shape. the playfulness, we decided to use kinetic energy as a power sour okay. that's conceptual, yes. mm. how many pages? alright. y you have you have done the first two. okay, and and the look and feel is yeah. the items we had to drop. where did we start with price? twenty six and a half. or not? or twenty six? something like that. this? speckles? uh yeah. yeah. some some big dots. yeah. .... we have the original balance sheet, or yeah. woah. just cut. control z_. yeah. yeah. just dual screen. very nice. yeah. y y you you you push the button or something. or lot of options. yeah, the r_ and another r_. it's called the real remote, right? maybe maybe it c it can say that. the real remote. yeah. welcome. yeah. yeah. you can copy and paste the picture if you want. yeah. what is that? look more looks more like a campfire. yeah. yeah. type in your report. i don't see any new messages. so hmm? luckily, yeah. what time do we have to deliver the report? four o'clock or or before that? just compare uh no it's on the on the beamer i guess. yeah. strange. this something what's projection from behind, i guess. yeah it it's a beamer, but then with a within a mirror, yeah. so it looks like a big screen, but in fact it isn't. well it's it's single single curved. th this is flat. yeah. but it's it's better to have in the front, this kind of shape, because it looks nice. i mean you see more of this than of that. yeah, more like that. it's not very uh ideal. do like this. yeah. what's this? ooh. but i don't see a detector over there. i thought it was a kind of thing to put it on, and then draw right lines or something. yeah. or just messed it up. yeah. yeah but it wasn't good. yeah it it has to touch the corners, i guess. but th this one wasn't good, because if i was drawing here, i drew a line and then it came over here. oh. ooh. yeah yeah, it's it's okay. it's working again. it's better than before. yeah. yeah that's improved uh pretty much. yeah. yeah but it's better, it's better mm. no. it's better than it was i guess. silly. yeah. works pretty well. five minutes before the meeting's over. and then? we have to present alright. so it after the after after these five minutes, you have to alright. after after that five minutes, you have ten minutes to finish it, or alright. and we uh right. chill. huh. uh yeah? next slide. yeah? how do you do it? alright. yeah. yeah. and we move more to to working together as team, because at first you you make your individual contribution, and then come here, and you have no idea what the others have to make. and then finally you have some idea, okay this is gonna w this is what we gonna make together and okay i will arrange this and you will arrange that, and you have a k a kind of idea what you can expect on the next half hour when you have to work on your own. so the process, i mean, the interaction between us became better and better i guess. yeah, especially if f f if you see uh you se you saw the largest difference from the first to the second meeting i guess. yeah. yeah. li limiteded afterwards, but if if you don't take that into account, there's plenty of room for creativ creativity. also not only the drawing and the the making of the thing itself, but also in explaining it to the other people, by means of uh the the board and uh powerpoint and word and stuff like that. mm uh i think in in essence the digital pen is better than the smartboard. because it it it just works better. i mean uh uh i've made yeah, uh i've made several notes just to test it, and and just put the pen in into it, and then it came onto my screen and it looked perfectly. so it it's better a better device than uh than the screen. but the screen is useful, in essence, but it doesn't work that well. yeah. yep. warning. finish meeting now. well, it it's use especially useful, i guess, to to evaluate designs and graph graphical stuff. and and the screen and stuff like that. yeah. yeah. yeah. but it it's useful to to show something to to an a small audience, and then to yeah. these these kind of screens this size are useful to discuss things. so yes. check your email. you also. right. yes boss. well see you soon. yeah.
