okay. here we go. alright, the agenda for thi oh. alright. um the agenda for this meeting is um we'll initially have the prototype presentation by our two designers. and then we will evaluate it, given the criteria that um that we gave gave it. and um talk about our finances, whether we were under or over our budget. i have a um a spreadsheet where we can calculate um our prices for every aspect of of what we've made, given our options. and um evaluate the product, as a group. and um so first we'll have the prototype presentation. do you need the um powerpoint for this? alright. on? a mango. okay. oh. okay. oops. yeah. notice you have a number ten button. okay. no problem. ah. oh. you press a plus button? oh okay. i've never heard of that kind before. yeah. yeah. oh. i but would you have to go zero plus one if you wanted to go to channel one or two? yeah but i mean if you press, it'll go to that channel right away. 'cause you gotta press the plus afterwards. yeah i know, but if if i wanna go to say number like sixty five, channel sixty five, if i press the six it'll go to channel six, and then i'll press the plus, and then it'll go to six and then put the five and it'll go to sixty five? i th um yeah it wouldn't be a problem. but i was just wondering like as long as we realise that's what it'll do. yeah. c_ and v_. right, where um where's the power button? oh okay. yeah. yeah. oh okay. yeah. ergonomic, definitely ergonomic. the spon yeah. yeah. bit of a stress ball feel. yes. i would. my goodness. there you go. genevieve? yeah. and something hmm. oh right. yeah. it looks more think like vanilla and banana would. okay yeah. kinda christmas, you know. yeah. cool. alright, thank you very much. good work everyone. alright. and so now that we've we have a prototype, uh we need to go over the finances and seeing if this prototype matches uh what our budget can handle. so, i have something i'm going to oh wait a minute. do you need to do a presentation first? yeah. i'm gonna check that out for a second. what time is it anyw oh yeah sorry you're right. evaluation criteria is next in line. yeah. just press um function eight again. and then again i think. one more time. yeah. yeah. okay. ooh. yeah. the look is a little bit more playful. oh definitely different yeah. oh you were only given red and black? oh okay. yeah. okay. yeah. yeah. it's mango. it's mango. yeah. i would say two. personally. yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah. i'd say maybe three. yeah we want it simple. yeah. i think so. yeah. yeah. one. th the plus number thing. yeah colour will definitely be a factor. i think that the logo could be smaller. and maybe not such a prominent way. maybe like at the bottom, kind of. oh it just had to be on there i guess. i like the appeal of it being like a big glob in your hand. maybe if the bottom was just sort of flat, and then the rest is like round. it would still be comfortable i think. we c we could handle it i think. ah it'd fall over all the time though. it'd be annoying. 'kay we're done designing. come on. i think, it was another colour and it was like i think it'd look okay. i think maybe a two. sure. yeah. yeah. durable. but you're our marketing expert. oh. exactly. exactly. yeah. i would give it a two still though. mm. oh yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah. we have the alarm system. i thought the light from the inside was gonna light up. or or was it gonna make a noise? you press the button it makes a noise right? yeah. awesome. awesome. i though w it was gonna make a noise. okay. oh okay. whoo. okay. yeah, totally. no problem, mm. totally. yeah. yeah, so it's just like channel six, six, enter. yeah but you don't have to press zeros. and then like twelve, enter. yeah. yeah. i think so. it's like right in the your thumb might get a little bit uh yeah. but it is soft. and that's kind of what the um the powerpoint slide thing said would be good for r_s_i_, so maybe it is but yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah. yes we did. well, yeah the colours are yellow and grey. so it could be grey on the banana one. yeah. mm, yeah. hum. i would say so. but maybe more like two 'cause there's no like pictures of fruit, it's just sort of naming it by a fruit. with the with the colours. yeah. yeah. that's fashionable in itself to have interchangeable plates. be like yeah. maybe if it was scented. yeah we have money for that. um alright so based on this evaluation, do we average them out sorta thing? oh. i would say two. one point nine or something? i don't know these things. um, between one and two. alright. yeah. i'm attempting to do that right now. yeah it is one point nine. ooh. go heather pauls. yeah. alright, now with that over and done with, our next step is to see if we are under budget. and um my computer's frozen. and now it's not. okay. so um in our shared folder, if everyone could go there right now, um i'm going to um steal a cable. um it's it's um it's an excel file. oh. yeah. 'kay there we go. um, production costs. and um i have to access that as well. one moment. 'kay so far i've added what i think or what is going on? great. it's blinking at me. it's locked for editing. read only. i'm gonna open up a second one then 'cause it's locked for editing. i have the original in my um my email account. i dunno. no. no, i was hoping that you guys could. um, there we go. okay here we go. so we need to tally up how much our w our product will be costing. so um if you can look up at the screen, um the large screen, oh i guess looking at your own too and telling me which one you think. okay we're using kinetic which is quite a large expense at three euros. um we're using a regular chip. um, it's cur it's double curved, so its curved all around. that's another three. we're already at five. um, we're using plastic and rubber, so good thing plastic is free, we're at eight. um s yeah. i guess we should do it just for one kind. so it's like special colour well we'll have two colours right? well one colour for the case, one colour for the buttons. so we can um, we have push button interface, so that's inexpensive. and um we have a special colour for the button, and we also have a special form. and a special material. which puts us just barely under budget. hurray. yeah. good work guys. so um our operating cost is twelve twenty euros. awesome. and back to our powerpoint. so we've 'kay. yes we are. so we need to do a product evaluation, again, which is probably um i dunno. a different extension of a hmm. yeah 'cause we're talking about leadership, teamwork. yeah. alright so um do you guys feel like there was room for creativity? pushed for creativity? ye okay. so it'd be like need more time and materials. but you were allowed m creativity? i think so as like but you were supposed to have creativ right. right okay great. leadership? is this me being like, guys do you like me? um. yeah. yeah. oop okay. teamwork? i think we worked great as a team. yeah? alright how were our means? we needed more play doh colours. yeah. but ever everything else was satisfactory? is that good yeah? new ideas found. i don't really know what that means. hmm? yeah. yeah. yeah. each other's mm. okay? well with that achieved, our last slide is our closing slide. yes our costs are within budget. it's evaluated generally positively. and um don't forget to complete final questionnaire and meeting summary. then we celebrate in such a way that i have no idea. alright? okay, bye.
okay. um yeah. i just got a few slides, so show them. thank you. do you want to present it? yeah, here we are. mango shape. the l_e_d_. so it's palm-held. yeah. you just need the nought. so one plus one would be eleven, or yeah because if you on your average um remote, if you press one twice you just go to um or uh say you wanted channel twelve, you press one, and then you go to channel one, and then two then you'd just go to channel two, instead of twelve. so if you did like one plus two you could go to channel twelve, or two plus two is channel twenty two. oh. well i don't mind, we can further define that. i wouldn't have thought it'd be a problem that it went to channel six first, in like on the way to channel sixty five. but i suppose it's not as snappy. yeah. yeah. if you don't put it yeah. yeah, that yeah. mm-hmm. um and channel, which is so you could just go like that without thinking about it, like it's the bigger r_. so it's just like. we deci yeah um we went for like a a circular design for the numbers because we thought that's kind of a more natural movement than just going like that with your thumb. uh e ergonomics are all considered. yeah. it could cause another type of repetitive stress injury though. but yeah, no i mean it's a different movement so yeah. um and the feel of it, i mean, we've made this out of play doh, which is representing the, you know, the rubber, and the spongy rubberness. um 'cause it was said before in the material specification that this the this anti-r_s_i_ um material is often used in stress balls so this has got a you know a bit of give to it, and it just feels feels different. would you like to feel it yourselves? how it fits in the palm of your hand? thanks. and you? o okay, as for the colours, we were presented with um a limited range of colours for this prototype. but we're thinking that, seeing as we're having it in interchangeable casing anyway, that this is not necessarily a representation of the true colours that we would necessarily use. or the combination. um and we're thinking to carry-on with the fruit and vegetable theme, the colour um combination just could just be named after different fruit, like banana could be black and yellow, watermelon red and green, or vanilla might be the most popular if it just uh blends in more settled cream instead of the others are all a bit garish. banana's more representative of our colour scheme, like the company the yellow and black. so that for corporate identity that would probably be the most strength. i mean watermelon, you know, m probably appealing to the yeah, seasonal. apple green, brown, more kinda trendy, you know, khaki yeah. okay. um yeah we thought of the components it was definitely um a focus of ergonomics and just a single ha handheld device, i mean you don't need to use both hands, one hand to hold this and type in with the other, you can just use your thumb. um, as we said the rubber's probably used for comfort and anti-r_s_i_ and that's about it. mm-hmm. mm go feel i think. we've been quite successful with the rubber coating and yeah. i think the colour has a lot to do with it. i mean th the colours we were given for making the prototype aren't the colours that i think we would've necessarily chosen. it's not the kind of ooh uh at all sleek red, black and yellow, and orange. um but if you can imagine that in like a s just a maybe uh a kind of pale metallic-y finish or something well i know know it's for rubber. i mean diff if you can visualise this in nice colours i think it would look quite fancy. oh well, potato, mango, fruit and veg. potato's fine. potato's fine. yeah. totally. it's really adaptable. for the fancy i uh two, three. yeah and the use of the rubber. for the anti-r_s_i_. the l_e_d_ use isn't particularly innovative and we don't have any scroll buttons, it's all pushbuttons, there's no l_c_d_ control, so if we're thinking about the rest of the market, it's sort of probably halfway. in some aspects it is, like we said. yeah. though it was our specification. yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah and perhaps the turning on but mm. again i think the colour comes into this. okay. not in don't worry. i suppose i've got quite big hands. thing is like that, it's not going anywhere particularly. yeah. uh yeah, it's less um, what's th ha. h it's got higher centre of gravity like that. i would definitely go for that rather than like your average plain old remote like that, but definitely in another colour, i'm not happy with those colours. yeah. yeah. yeah. and the kinetic energy, shaker-style-y, whoo, ooh no. but you know, those'll be firmly on. mm, yeah, that's true. yeah. good point. yeah. yeah. does this prototype match the operating behaviour of the average user. yeah. because yeah, because the most accessible buttons are the volume and the and the channel-changing. and it's just you won't have to think about it. you don't have to look down to find them. they're clearly there, easy to use. simple. yeah. mm. yeah. it yeah l lights on and, or flash as well. but i mean it's not obviously obvious from the outside that that's gonna happen 'cause you can't s particularly see an alarm. yeah. but when the alarm's not yeah. if you yeah. you could s yeah. well the thing is, if it was had an alarm system, i mean, when it when it lights up as we i mean it could light up when the alarm went. but if it was hidden underneath the cushion or something, there wouldn't be any point. so you can't see the alarm, but it would light up. yeah. alarm, but you can't see an alarm inside uh the alarm system itself. yeah. yeah. it w yeah. sorry. yeah. sorry heather. that wasn't very clear. yeah i think just because it's we've decided to reduce it down to the basic buttons, i think that in itself makes it so much easier to use. mm. and or sixty six enter, y yeah i think that's probably more straightforward. yeah. good ooh. mm. oh. injury. yeah, that's what i was thinking. we may have to do some more research into other strain injuries that we don't know about. mm-hmm. mm. yeah. i think we're getting that's true. mm. i think yeah, i think too. yeah. mm. yeah. i think this is the the factor that we've been least successful in confronting. yeah. four i think. well i don't what do what okay. yeah. like um the colour scheme names and stuff. yeah. yeah. yeah. it is. the thing is, i think if somebody saw that and you said what was that inspired from, i don't know if you'd instantly say mango. oh yeah. there we go. that would be great. um okay. it's between one and two. so that's pretty fantastic. mm. it seems like it should be more around two. do we have an online calculator? okay. oh wow. well done. well that's excellent. production costs. it says it i think it just means that we can't add any more to it now. have you have you completed it? oh right. okay. okay. yeah. yeah. yeah. double double-curved yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah. mm-hmm. oof. congratulations guys. of the actual project rather than the product? a project? is is yeah. so wh how we actually went round uh about doing it. i think we were pushed. i mean we weren't really given a lot of time, or materials, yeah, to go about our design task. so i think we could've done with a bit more time. yeah. yeah. yeah. well we were just limited by resources really and like if we had decided to use the l_c_d_ screen, and like solar power backup and everything, then we wouldn't have been able to afford that. so that did limit creativity. just resources. but yeah. the fruit and veg idea. yeah we did. we've, uh seeing as we've come out with what we intended. a pro um a product within the budget. i think that's a sign of good leadership and also our personal coach helped us along the way, so you know i think it's been fine. yeah. good timing. and project manager of course. yeah. yeah. um yeah and more play doh, 'cause that was all the red we had. so even if we wanted to make a bigger prototype, we wouldn't have been able to. yeah. it could be really straightforward for the computer. i think the only thing was having to remember to you know to tick the okays but i think i was the only one who struggled with that. mm. uh me too. yeah. well i think we've all learnt stuff from each other, like the n um yeah. just about each different. got new ideas from each other. yeah. yeah. sorry? oh yeah. well mm, did it come into the into i dunno if we counted that in the costs. yes. uh. fantastic. okay, brilliant. thank you very much.
um this is what we came up with. it's a pretty simple design. it's um based on a mango? yeah. and we yeah. and we have the company logo here and this will be the infrared here and this'll be the power point, the on off button kind yeah. it's in the middle of one of the little r_s. and then the other one is the power. and uh we just have a simple design. we wanted it all to be accessible from your thumb yeah palm-held and all the buttons are accessible from your thumb. so you don't have to oh that was a mistake, wasn't it? right no, that's a zero. take that one off. sorry. i was in charge of the numbers. and this is just if you've got like eleven or twelve or thirt the plus. you can go one, three or something. you press that first and then you go one three yeah. well we just thought, we have all the numbers here, so we wanted something representative of numbers larger than ten and so the plus and then yeah. no no, th all that's why we have all these numbers. these numbers um these numbers all work independently up to nine. yeah. oh no. uh, the plus is only for if you're going past the number nine. you p oh. no you press the plus first. i i well it doesn't we haven't really s i would've thought you pressed the plus first and then the six five, but she says plus press which what do you think is simpler? it's a yeah. yeah. oops. yeah. yeah. yeah. so a channel. just so we can flick it's in the middle of one of the little r_s. yeah, so it's all accessible. without m taking your hand off the remote. and it might actually help with the repetitive stress injury as well. okay. yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah. of play doh yeah. 'cause it'd be quite subtle and yeah. yeah, yeah, yeah. the pomegranate's kinda girly and funky kind of, and then the vanilla's more for the more sophisticated customer who just wants something that fits in with all decor. yeah. mm. well yeah. yeah. yeah so not very sleek and we don't wanna go for black because most remote controls are black or grey. so we want it to be stand out that way, anyway. yeah. a metallic-y finish we were thinking. polished. okay yeah. we we were we were thinking about yeah. i w i'd say two i think. fanciness. yeah. yeah. mm. i'll go for three as well. no. wouldn't be simple, yeah. yeah. yeah very. i think one for that. yeah. no. yeah that's the only thing yeah. it's definitely yeah. but the remember the management said that it it had to be prominent. yeah. yeah. but you know what i've just thought of there now. what where's it gonna sit in your living room? is it not gonna fall off the arm of the sofa? yeah. but then it wouldn't sit as comfortably in your hand. yeah. oh that would be nice. yeah. three. you would though, 'cause it's bit it's more interesting than other remotes. yeah. yeah. i think we have to market it in the right way, that um to say that it is simplistic. so people don't just see it and think, uh, this is so simplistic, i don't want to spend twenty five euros. we have to market it. and the kinetic energy part. yeah. don't shake oh no the plus. you're use the zero. make a new one. i think they're about ten po ten pound, aren't they? about ten pounds. fifteen? yeah. mm. yeah. i think it does very well. the zap yeah. uh yeah. yeah the bu when you press the alarm system, the lights behind the and it'll vibra it'll be again in the marketing. yeah. the light it will. but but both yeah. oh, that would be brilliant. i'd be tempted to yeah. it would have to be in the market yeah but you still couldn't see it. it would just be a little speaker on the back or something. so the plu the plus w once that's written down on the page that'll be really simple, won't it? yeah. that kind of annoys me though, when it's zero six when you have to press i don't know why. oh okay. right. alright, aye. yeah. i'd say w yeah one. yeah. yeah. hmm. but if you're zapping yeah. i don't think it will f yeah, the biology. mm. yeah. yeah. i i'd say t two. yeah. yeah. n we we can't really do that because for example on the banana theme we can't have it as being yellow. it won't stand out. so n it's not always gonna be the same colour. gray, yeah. yeah, could be grey. yeah that's right, we didn't even rea yeah. perhaps a metallic or or like that's grey, and it wouldn't be that expensive to have a little bit of metal. no? that isn't rubber. okay. following that briefing we did. yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah. i think w yeah, i think one. well that was our brief and we followed the brief. well we haven't got a big banana but oh yeah. no. no. oh that would be class. yeah. two. it's yeah. close to two. yeah. i got yeah, 'cause we've a four to bring down. uh, aye. yeah. uh, should've added five. this is. yay. is that the project document? yeah. oh right. what about a special colour? are we using that? yeah. and a special material. yeah. that's good. yeah. the ma or materials. yeah. yeah. yeah. creativity. yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah, it c it might've been bigger. yeah. i'm actually not sure if i've saved my presentations. yeah. through discussion. yeah. and we were a able to modify each other's ideas to fit in with our areas of expertise. if if it if it if it can be afforded. yeah. yay. yeah.
i'm sorry. what was the where's the l_e_d_? oh. okay. oh, there's no e okay. okay. sixty. well the there is a there's a delay on remotes i think. where you can have it it's like a five second input time. so as long as you hit them dada it should be fine. as long as there's not a big pause between the t hitting the two buttons. was there so on the top there is volume and channel up volume up. okay cool. yeah. it's the r_. mm-hmm. mm-hmm. yes. oh it's nice. oh i think i killed the five. i did. i killed the four. oh god. oh it smells good. bravo you want the i don't know what order it goes in. i have one. evaluation cri okay. that's me. hello. oh there we go. okay. come on my computer. come on. sorry my computer's giving me technical difficulties. should i press it again? last time i did that it sh okay. you're right. oh. still not there. okay now i think for this one i could would you guys prefer use the whiteboard or mayb maybe i'll just do it on right on the screen where you can see it. um, we're gonna be doing an evaluation report together based on the protoptype that we've just seen. um and looking looking back at my notes from our both our conceptual and our functional meetings, um i made a list of what our original requirements and goals were, um, back to our kick-off meeting this morning. um, and we'll evaluate as to whether we've s done what we set out to do. um and we're gonna do it on a one to seven scale where one is true and seven is false. so basically the lower p the lower the points the better. okay so question number one. does the remote whoops. sorry. oh i'm not gonna be able um, i'll do it on the whiteboard. i can't change it so i'm g i'm gonna ask you to push it down once. i'll write down our scores up on the okay so number one. do we have a fancy look-and-feel? yeah i guess that depends on your definition of fancy, but it's definitely different. it's not your traditional yeah. mm-hmm. yeah. mm-hmm. yeah. i kinda i like the potato look. it's very different. it's what? oh sorry the mango the mango look. yeah it is, fruit or vegetable depends on your mood. so i myself would say a one or a two. it's a two? okay, and p one being true. so two. okay, actu that's pro that's gonna get confusing, like that. okay so question number two was is it techn technologically innovative? so i know we have the kinetic energy which is very innovative. use of the rubber, the use of the l_e_d_. isn't mm-hmm. yeah. and i think i mean it it's tough to say because we were we didn't want it to be any more innovative than this, because then that would've defeated the purpose. so i mean i we'll put three, but i think we actually reached our goal. we didn't want it any more than that. okay question number three. uh, will it be easy to use? yeah. yeah. s yeah i think it's you can't really get confused with that. i mean, there'll be s we have to work out the uh number the plus system. but once that's figured out, it should be fine. number four. is this a good-looking remote? remember that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly. mm-hmm. whoops. should just not touch it. this time it's the three i killed. i was just wondering if it should be like flatter. or well yeah the bottom could be like ch chopped a bit. oh. that's true. maybe, it could it could be on the bottom, so you wouldn't loo like if it's flat here, so it sits up. like that. i g if it's weighted maybe. details, details. okay. so, is this a good-looking remote? would we wanna show it off to our friends? yeah. yeah? i mean i gue yeah, it's personal taste, but yeah. okay, so should we say two for that? yeah? okay. uh, question number five. what's um will people be willing to spend twenty five euros on this product? remember that eighty percent of users were willing to spend more money when a remote control looked fancy. mm-hmm. yeah it the marketing will have a lot to do with it. shake it and the buttons fall off. no, i guess, i don't know much about the remote control industry, how much your average sells for, but i know i am, aren't i? but you don't have to buy batteries. so in the long term this can actually save you money. so we'll market it that way too. so yeah i think with a good marketing scheme um and the personalisation options, it'll yeah. okay number six. can someone read it out? or um yeah. so that was mainly that the statistics we said mm-hmm. yeah i guess the i think the key word there is average, 'cause there were some people that used the uh video input and sound and stuff. but they're not you and i really. so. okay so one? okay. number seven. c heather could you push it down? will this remote control be easy to find when lost? remember that fifty percent of users lose their remote regularly. now is there the is the alarm system still was it implemented? it turns into a duck and starts quacking. here i am. um okay. we oh you're just explaining why it's not on the prototype. but yeah, it'll be there. so we can we could say that we can give it a one, because compared to every other remote ever m ever made, this one will be easier to find. okay. um question number eight. will it be easy to learn how to use this remote when brand new? remember that thirty four percent of users usually found it difficult. so it has to be yeah, it's eas they'll pick it up and they'll know what to do. the plus thing needs to be worked on. yeah. well do does it make more sense for the middle one to be an just an enter button? so then you would have to push two buttons every time at least. you could just press six enter, or one two enter. yeah. um, okay so we can we'll say yes it's uh one? okay. question number nine. uh, will it minimise the effects of r_s_i_, which was repeated strain injury? um, which affected over a quarter of users. s it's soft, and and people could mm-hmm. i don't know what other options there are. could i mean, you could hold it in your left hand and d use your index finger. but there's not really any other options unless it's like a keyboard. so, i think we did as as much as you can with a remote control. so, one or two do you think? two okay. okay number ten. did we somehow incorporate the company colour and logo? now is the colour gonna be there even if it's like vanilla? is the yellow mm-hmm. it sounds like the colour's something that we but i mean the yell yeah d yellow's ugly though, depending on the so i think we'll have to talk to our executive managers, and see if we can get away with just the r_r_. okay. yeah. and the buttons in the middle. okay. so, do you think that's more of a three then? three, four? four? well we have good reasons for it, so we but we can still put a a four? okay, and final question. um, did we stay true to our motto and put the fashion into electronics? current trends of fruits and veggies, desire for sponginess. yeah. no, uh, are the plates interchangeable? i think i missed a few they are? so you can have banana and kiwi and okay. okay, so that's something that's kind of in the making too, like maybe it'll become more mm-hmm. yes we do. so i wh what was i gonna put for that? a two for fashion? okay, so our average there, five, six, eight, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fifteen, nineteen, twenty one, divided by eleven is between okay. um. yeah, that's very good 'cause the highest we coulda got is one. does that seem right then? okay. sorry. are you gonna do that? okay. oh is it locked 'cause i'm in it? or okay. mm. 's good. mm-hmm. yeah and the conceptual and functional. like we were very creative in in coming up with an idea i guess, but m when we can down to it. okay. mm-hmm. yeah. good leadership, i think we stayed on task. mm-hmm. and the timing was good. we never were pushed for time, or sat around doing nothing, so was good teamwork. i think we are well-suited to our roles. oh really? okay. yeah. the computer programmes are good. the yeah. i don't think there was anything yeah. they'll probably still be there. um i'm not sure, new ideas found. yeah well i guess we really it we bounced off of each other, which was cool. like based on marketing stuff and then you'd say something about interface and yeah, worked well. mm-hmm. oh does it have smart materials by the way? does it have smart materials? oh yeah. mm-hmm. mm-hmm. by watching t_v_? mm. conclusion? dadada.
