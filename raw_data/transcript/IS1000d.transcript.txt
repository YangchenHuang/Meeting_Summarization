did you get my email with the slides? ah. tricky. dunno. maybe they're supposed the pen's supposed to go over the seats. might be seat floor rather than person. yeah, put it back. yep. yeah. jo's making faces at me. mm-hmm. mm. mm, object tracking. okay. well we can't no we can't do evaluation 'til we have a design. mm-hmm. mm 'kay. mm-hmm. mm-hmm. mm-hmm. mm-hmm. oh yeah. mm-hmm. yeah. mm-hmm. okay so it's it's t a very basic remote then, it's only mm. mm. can i see? thanks. okay i like the volume control, that's good. uh-huh. so it doesn't actually have buttons. did you wanna see? mm. it won't talk back. right. mm-hmm. mm-hmm. mm. so it's well outside the budget then. that's on top of the sixteen, or is it part of that? so that takes it down to thirteen euros without the speech recognition. mm-hmm. mm. what's this one on the side? ah okay. mm-hmm. mm 'kay. i like the shape of them, i do like the the size and the the shape. mm-hmm. okay. and maybe we run the evaluation on both of the products, both of these two. okay. basically this is what we've talked about already, um, from the marketing point of view. we just wanna make sure that we've taken into account yep. so it's just a shortlist of criteria on um the things that we've identified as being important to selling the product. um we just go through these and rate them as a group and then at the end we'll make an evaluation based on that, so just average the score of those items, so these are the things we identified as being important. um the three things were look and feel, innovation and ease of use, were the three important components um appealing to the correct demographic so using those things in the right way to appeal to our demographic. and then goin following the company motto, following the fashion trends and putting that into the product as well. so well do you wanna go through and put through those on the the two products now or do we wanna discuss them further and then evaluate them? okay. so f just go through onto the whiteboard i guess. not sure how this is gonna come out. so the first one was really very far below budget, would you want to take the price down of the end product according to that or just have the high profit on it? 'cause if we're only going to make it for eight euros then we have a mm-hmm. mm-hmm. yep. mm-hmm. okay so look and feel, innovation mm-hmm. and trends. oh, you following the idea of using the um removable covers on these? is that part of both of them or? okay. mm-hmm. mm-hmm. mm-hmm. no. mm-hmm. okay. okay. yep. so it's the pink. and the other one's green. okay, so look and feel? where um one is i've broken the pen again. s yeah. get that one. um w one's bad and seven's the best. sorry, one's true and seven's false. one's the best. so on a scale of one to seven? mm-hmm. mm-hmm, yeah. mm-hmm. mm-hmm. mm-hmm. mm. on the scale u it's between functional and fancy basically we're looking at, so mm-hmm. four? okay. mm-hmm. mm. no that's the ink's dried. battery's low, isn't it the ink? the b that's the that that one? battery there. mm. no i think it's lost a battery. no it's it would still write but it wouldn't pick it up with the sensors. you got a second? well we won't be able to tell. is that working? did it come out? good. okay. because we'll be able to see it still even if it wasn't working, it's just a normal whiteboard marker but it wouldn't be picked up on the the actual whiteboard. and the other one? i think it's slightly better, um, it's hard to tell from just the plasticine, but mm. mm. okay. mm-hmm. yeah. yeah. the other thing is, is the left hand one protruding? 'cause if people are left handed they want to use the other hand, maybe it won't work so well. okay. i'd say two or three for that one, personally. probably more towards three than two. okay. mm, okay. yeah it's d it's definitely more fancier than that one. okay. so, consensus? two or three? two? um, 'kay. innovation. the first one, not really muc mm. yeah. do we mm. what what features are we actually including? are we including like a location kind of thing like trying to find it? there's nothing like that? but th is there any there's no actual innovation in that at all, it's just a straight-out remote control. okay. okay. so there's no this uh look and feel thing, though that's not a technological innovation. so i'd be up for seven for innovation. okay. so what is it, what are the innovations with this? got the l_c_d_ screen. is that in this one though? is this 'cause this is the th th there were different options we discussed then, we discussed the one that was in budget and the one that was out of budget. okay. so the cost for these were what was the cost for the first one? eight euros? and this one was sixteen euros. okay. so. innovation for this one is two? one? two? mm. well the speech recognition is a very good innovation i believe it, so give it a one? yep. okay. ease of use? mm. yeah. yep. so that's maybe a a two for ease of use. okay. so maybe a three or a four. mm. okay. consensus? three or four? three? okay. mm-hmm. okay. so three's uh how well it goes to the target demographic. so we're d we're still thinking twenty to forty year olds? that's mm. so sh completely changed our demographic there, it's not part of the the funky young thing. yeah. if it was the very bottom price range or it was like between this and another one we did the same thing then i can imagine it being applying to the the demographic yeah. that's it's still ye mm. 'cause we have got room, we've got some budget there to add a few things to it, that's right. mm-hmm. and mm. but it's going to be cheap whatever though, it was set with i we've got a set price. yeah. there's nothing that would make me spend an extra k few euros on that one rather than another one. okay. um and the demokraphi demographic of the second one? it's got the got the the toys in it, it's got the l_c_d_ screen and mm. yeah. mm-hmm. yeah. i think especially if we're gonna n have an l_c_d_ screen on a low range product then that's good. mm. okay. i'd probably go with three again for that one. mm-hmm. okay. so, two, yeah? mm-hmm. yeah. yep. and especially i guess 'cause this has the speech recognition as well, and that makes it more appealing, it's more of a a new fun toy. mm-hmm. okay. and following the trends. so the trends were the fruit and vegetables and the spongy feel. so as it is, not really doing either of them. well, the spongy could be part of the the feel of the buttons as well, i know some have you tried the mobile phones that have got the kinda spongy buttons and not not exactly spongy but i'm thinking one of the nokias that's got like you ca it hasn't got individual buttons it's got just a one bit on it and so you can that feels kinda spongy. so it's sort of, yeah. mm. okay. but that's if you're using the covers. or is it just one well they make it for mobiles, it can't be that much more complicated. so you got the option of having different colours or different textures. mm. mm. mm-hmm. i think the if we do the cover that's really going with the company's philosophy of having the fashion in in electronics, it lets people have the latest fashion even next year when fruit and vegetables might be out, you'll still be able to put a new cover on it and then it'll still be in fashion. mm. mm. mm. mm. yep. yep. mm. and then you have the option of having the different colours, different covers. mm. there's n yeah. 'cause that's the that's the feature that could be included in either of them. although it is more with the spongy buttons on the um on the other one. okay. so. two and three, or one and two? mm-hmm. okay. okay so the average of that is three six nine divided by five, so five mm nine by five, one point s eight? this one, eleven thirteen nineteen twenty one, divided by five is four point two yep. okay. but we still got a very different price for those two so they're not really comparable yet anyway. yep. yep. mm-hmm. well it's easier to just make that one cheaper by just taking the speech recognition out. that'll basically take us down to the budget. mm. yeah, it's gonna be more than just the biggest case, definitely. either of them. mm. they're both going to be not basic cases. mm-hmm. yeah. the basic one, yep. so now we're either going button or l_c_d_s, l_c_d_ display. is that price per unit, or for the whole thing? so it would need twelve buttons. mm. and that's without any special button supplements. so we'd have a special colour, special form and special material on all of them. they're not just standard buttons. but i thought it would be curved on two it's like it's curved on the sides and curved on the top and bottom as well, that's what i thought. you talking about concave curves? you think a single curved? mm. we have more, we've got those the scroll wheel on the side and yeah the sc mm. we've got a scroll wheel for the volume don't we, or is it some other thing that's not on there. 'kay we've only got five minutes left guys so we need to wrap it up pretty fast. so this is even more than the um than the cost you gave, the sixteen euros. but that's seven basic buttons right, seven buttons without any adds-on, without special colours or form or material. well so the l_c_d_ display is is three francs, sorry three euros, by itself. mm. so twelve euro fifty, we got two off of the battery, we can't do anything about that, so ten fifty, if we want an l_c_d_ dispra display, that's seven fifty um, so we've got seven fifty to use for the case and for the buttons. and the chip. sorry the chip's up there already. so we're gonna have to scale this down to get within budget, there's no doubt about that. mm. yep. mm. yeah. i think, unless we can really drive these prices down we need to get rid of the l_c_d_ display. for the price, it's gonna be what we can afford, and it's looking like we can't afford the l_c_d_ display, there's no way we can get it in there. mm. mm-hmm. i th i'd like t it to be in but i can't see it happening. i can't see it fitting in. bu y you're a power voter uh veto anyway as project manager. well we have to make a decision now, that's it. mm. i think then we we're really losing ease of use. okay. okay. so l_c_d_'s out, is speech rec out now? we've yep. yep. so are we basically back to the original one now, back to the first version? which turns out to be on budget exactly, pretty much. with these new costings. so just look at forget that one and look at that one now. mm. yep. okay. well that's that's yep. so. mm. yep. so w we can go back and l talk to the suppliers maybe and see if we can drive the prices down to add a few more things in but that's all we can do with the restrictions we have at the moment. mm-hmm. okay.
okay. so. matthew is uh late again. probably an important man. um. so well it is important for him to be here uh. he he he you did work together didn't you? yes. yes. yes. mm. um yes but w we yes, maybe we should phone him. um well um, when he is not here we will just we just have to continue. um so just for record i i will take uh notes again. and um well first thing uh i was uh uh i got an email from uh from my superior again that we really should stay within the budget of the uh twelve euro and fifty cents. it's uh well he said to me well uh when you stay in it's good, when you don't stay in you have to redesign. there is no uh no negotiation uh possible in this matter. so we have to consider that. good. um so maybe anna, you can have your presentation. okay matthew. nice uh you are here. great. great. oh ma maybe then you can start now with mm presenting your uh your designs. mm. eye. uh-huh. yes. ah, okay. mm-hmm. yeah. yeah. yeah. mm. exce except for the for the special shape, the surfing board, it has a quite a a conventional layout of buttons uh. mm-hmm. yeah no you can carry on, i just look how it feels all. yes it really feels like like like a mobile phone. just i'm i really want to talk to it. but. so but but continue with your uh mm-hmm. mm. mm-hmm. mm-hmm. from d_v_d_ player to television or something. yes. mm. yes and and and then you get feedback via the l_c_d_ yeah. mm-hmm. mm-hmm. mm-hmm. mm-hmm. mm. yeah but but but but uh i in there uh when this is closed, will it also uh cover up the l_c_d_ screen? but but the l_c_d_ screen i mean is a very uh well an eye-attracting feature which shouldn't be shouldn't be that th that's true. mm. mm-hmm. mm-hmm. yes. yes, more robust. yes okay. mm-hmm. okay. but w mm 'kay. hmm. mm-hmm. mm-hmm. well well mm. be before ta talking about the money and what's possible and what is not possible, maybe anna you can uh give our uh give us your um yes. evalua evaluation and also the evaluation criteria, so what what is important to look at. mm-hmm. well just do it quickly if if we al already. mm-hmm. mm-hmm. um, n no why not why not discuss uh discuss it now, mm, well my my personal view is uh w when when this one is eight euros we must think how can we improve it. and then i mean w w w you must just see it we can still spend this four and a half euro and to r because th th th the the selling price is already prite fik uh uh quite fixed on twenty five euros so we just have to offer as much as as well value for the for the customer uh he can have for twenty five euro. mm. um well w w we can still discuss that. so um, and together with evaluating this uh we we might come with new ideas i mean adding things or uh removing uh of options because they are too expensive, but um i've received uh a framework which we can do this. i mean did you have this this excel sheet? no okay, this is these are the the the latest prices of our production uh uh production unit for several components, so we can uh see whether the the price is is within the twelve euro uh fifty cents uh. so maybe we can start with this, uh, calling this one. th th this is the first design. yes. uh there is another pen. okay. 'kay. okay. so. look and feel. well you already feel that uh pretty much i think. in i in my opinion purely feel is is is very good, is very good in your hand, so i i i would consider two or or may maybe even one for feel. but that's just half, we should also consider look, and then i it looks quite conventional. don't you agree? so maybe two. hmm. hmm. ma ma ma ma maybe say say five i it's my opinion, but i don't know what what four, four. now we th th then we settle on four. 'kay. can you maybe fix the other mm, try it, just try it. oh it will not ri mm, mm. yes, it it has a mm. good. good. okay. so then then ah. mm. i i i when we want to include i i i'm doubting about this this component. it it it it breaks in your mm, yes i see, mm okay. well r r mm. i think the look is better but the feel is is is worse. so so i would also say this is four. but w w do you what do you think? mm. mm. yes. yes, it basically is the same shape. mm-hmm. mm. yeah. yeah. yeah. yes, okay. two? mm. two's good yes. mm. mm-hmm. mm-hmm. the only innova innovation is the shape. s so that mm. yes. a and the l_c_d_ screen is that's that's that's well it's quite innovative. mm. yeah. mm. mm. mm. mm. we just diske discuss it as you designed it and then we will will try to get it in the budget. eight. yes. two. why it is one. a man w w yes. this this is it w with the speech recognition? well. gi given that that it works, then it's i think one. mm. hmm. three, i would. three. no. yeah. yes but then when when he is used to it, i i it is quite easy. so so i think th three is good. yeah. good. what's the next? so twe twenty to forty, yes that's mm-hmm. well exce except for the surfing shape. i mean that's that's something which which has an appeal on this group i think, but mm w w w we after this we can can consider uh for instance, making this more attractive to to the demographic mm. but as it is now, i w would say mm, six, something. do you agree? mm, yeah, indeed. th t t ju just think, twenty five euros, i mean it's not going to be cheaper. mm. mm. okay. yeah tha tha tha tha tha that's i think it's better, because of the l_c_d_ screen which is really an appeal on the on the on the on the and on the mm. so, the l_c_d_ screen uh attracts, yes. because it mm, ma maybe that's something to consider, yes, so. wh what what no s say t two. two? okay, the final point, trends. mm. mm. i think mm. mm. and the then we can al yes. we can we can consider uh uh is it possible do you think, to to make a cover for s such a phone? i mean well just with the with the flexible plastic uh i th i th i think o o or just two things which can be put on each other. yes, exactly like it. uh, so maybe we can but we have to decide it, we can put the the the fancy f look of vegetables for instance, to to these covers and s now try to invest in the in in the features. mm. mm mm mm mm mm. mm-hmm. mm-hmm. mm. mm. yes. so so so that that would make the trends equal, so we we we really have don't have, i mean mm. yes, indeed. yes. say, say one and two. one and two. so le le let's see. so d this one has spongy but buttons? mm, i see, yes okay. good. just add it. you know. three, six, seven. mm-hmm. we we must try to get them closer. both in i i or we just have to choose. and adapt. because, when we choose for this one we have to we have to make it more attractive and w when we to d for this one we have to make it more cheap. yes, well but i'm now did y did you work with the same prices that i have here? mm. mm, tha well yes, well uh re reconsider it. so let's let's try to to model this this phone in this sheet, uh what kind of energy source uh i i we didn't speak about that. it's a it's a normal battery, or yes. just so one battery. 'kay. electronics. given speech recognition i think w you should go for the less fancy chip. yeah, yes, or sample sensor, yes. yes, this one. okay. case? um, i see i double curve. mm. oh yes, we are talking about, but they have the same shape, but, actually bu so th th this would be double curves? 'kay. uh, plastic would be the material. uh special colour, now we leave it to the covers. push. mm, yes, but yeah th now this is per per unit, this number of components. so, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, t yes. twelve i believe. so this comes to eighteen. so so i think but th do you agree th that thi yes i yes i'm i'm no i'm no i'm not sh sure. yes i kno undes i understand what you mean, yes. uh-huh. both. yes. uh w d we have we haven't talk about a, but that's no a is very exp inexpensive i believe but it is not in the list. w ho h is this a scroll wheel or is this a a a sort of button which can be pressed on two sides uh so for higher and lower? mm. mm-hmm. so um we're we we could go for the for the for the for the for a simple chip, but then we can't have the the speech recognition, yes? yes? so so w when we w a this would this would be cutting the speech recognition. transti say say it's regular, regular chip, and we still on fifteen, so yes but that maybe well we can just say one. ca l we are just when we just want to uh to cut the number of buttons we have to make seven to to fit in in twelve twelve fifty. so is it possible? mm-hmm. no no, he he he i i mm-hmm. mm-hmm. otherwise y you ha you have a s ve very normal uh thing like this. mm. mm-hmm, mm-hmm. a mm mm. i i think we have to come to a decision now, just i i think we we what we just do i is vote about the uh the l_c_d_ uh display so yes. yes. yes. one man one vote. s so who thinks the the l_c_d_ disply display should be i should be in it? mm. mm-hmm mm-hmm. mm-hmm, i know, but yes. so uh uh having an l_c_d_ s display is just uh uh have very very limited amount of buttons. is that acceptable? ca can i have can the functions be implement in an you've you you agree. so hav hav having seven buttons, instead of twelve. so that wou would be cutting cutting suh say about these buttons. mm. mm. so um i i think we should we should cut the l_c_d_ screen. that that's that's my opinion. just uh where, l_c_ okay w we now we can just uh yes. yes. i th i th i think w we just go for this one and that that now twelve euros is the is is the price, okay. my m my supervisor will be glad that it's fifty cents cheaper than he expected. okay. okay, good. then we the same. thank you. that was it.
i guess i have to change the pen otherwise. will be completely different. yeah. and do you think it's. yeah. yeah. so what can you? yeah we will yeah, so i will be able to to summarize uh our meeting, but still i think uh it would be in very important if the uh as um main designer. i think we can put on the here. uh basically w yeah we we designed the two uh items. um, can we have a phone, can someone it's really w well designed. yeah. 'kay. yep. great. yep. so i will start by the the basic one that uh fits into uh eight euros actually, right, seven eight euros, and uh well first for both they have um a special shape, maybe the designer can uh explain better than me, but uh it's like a surf board. and you you are supposed to surf to browse to surf t_v_, maybe the web, and uh it's kind of interesting shape because um unconsciously people want to s to surf when they see this stuff. and also it's not too far from um a mobile. so people are used to that kind of shape, right. don't take care too much about the colour because w yeah we don't take yeah. so here would be basically the the the infrared uh uh led yeah l_a_ l_a_ l_e_d_, the on-off button, in red. here would be the volume. on the on the left, okay, so easy to turn on t and off. and um so this is a very cheap version so there are maybe you can carry on uh matthew. how can you change from v_c_r_ to uh t_v_, by the way? okay yeah. yeah yeah. yeah. seven, eight, ei eight euros. yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah actually, yeah. play, pause. exactly yeah. to audio and to video on demand. yes. this is the orange button, the microphone. an yeah. yeah. yeah. crazy dis designer, okay. yeah yeah yeah yeah. yeah. oh actually well. it's low weight. you have to see yeah yeah the the components we put inside is very low weight. so the the cost is actually a bit more, it's uh it's it's sixteen francs. sixteen euros sorry. then it's out of budget. but the the main point we we talk about that with our uh manufacturer. and they say basically that the s_r_ system would be uh something like three francs per item so three euros sorry. and um no no no, part of that, yeah. yeah, yeah. well i think th th yeah we should stick with uh a number of keys because if we add too much then it's too locati. location. yeah. mm-hmm. functionality. easy to use. target. no. yeah. yeah. four maybe. uh. yeah. if you press like this not like this then you but okay. try a perfect. yeah, yeah. yep. wow. 'kay maybe it's not a button it's a led, it's a ac actually yeah it should be embedded. yeah. oh you can push push it again, you can push it. yeah. and the l_c_d_ makes it better. yeah. so i will say two. i would say two, three. yep. basically there is no innovation in the first one compared to what exists in the market, right? yeah. the surf uh design. yeah. yeah. yeah. you're right. yeah. and the and the second one is really uh state of the art, uh in terms of innovation. and um with many more functionalities, and can open and close the the bottom part. yeah. and all the scrolling uh buttons and menu and pro programmable device behind this. uh could put it at one or two i would say. personally. uh yeah automatic speech recognition. yeah. so eight. well actually we have yeah to check again yeah. sixteen. w w un to be one what would do we nee actually, yeah, i don't see okay, one would would be without buttons,. bu yeah. so maybe we can put one. it's using speech recognition, yeah. yeah, one, yeah. so the first one is really standard, so everybody i including our grandmothers can use it, right? yeah. um, the other one is quite easy, tho though. one me um we hope maybe sometimes people get uh scared with the number of buttons. and there is a like i would say three. or maybe four. yeah, yeah because it's n uh it's not like a big one with uh one hundred buttons or so, this one would be uh for grandmothers. no. yeah, grandmothers, yeah. yeah that's true. yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah because it's so important it's i it was written that it really so important, the um the the look and uh taking care of its it targets, the right range of people, right? yeah. but w yeah. but for us it's yeah we have a constraint that we need to sell at twenty five euros. yeah. yeah. yeah. and if you want to target yeah if we we wish to to sell four millions of this, i think for this audience we need absolutely the l_c_d_ screen. yeah. or even even one and two. or two. yeah. two yeah. yeah. spongy, uh, that means that it goes in in the water. uh okay. but this one includes this feature, right? spongy buttons. so uh the maybe in the colour we can make it uh fruit and and veggie. yeah. yeah. this is possible. yeah exactly like nokia phones. yeah. 'cause sometimes look at this computer, th this laptop, it's all black, and uh it's quite conventional, and sometimes people don't like too much flashy colours like this one presented here. so maybe we could do like in the range the set of what we propose a black one, very standard one, that meets the the requirements of th such people that want really standard uh things. yeah. yeah, so a a point better for the for the number two. okay. yeah, the blue one uh spongy. nine. very good. yeah, it's right, yeah that's right. so i i give yeah i just give a call with the manufacturer uh and uh i explained them and they told me this could be possible for sixteen fr euros. uh unfortunately we didn't see this chip, uh matthew, so maybe we have to recap with this one. for this one it's a normal battery. uh sample speaker, yeah. sample, yeah, this one. so so which one are we talking to? well yeah. is it zero franc? l_c_d_ is. it's okay. just say l_c_d_. no but for this one it's twelve euro. there are twelve? wait a minute, it's not it's not double curved, it's single curved, right? because it's there is no like. well it's you know this curve like this so, it's w there is only is is is there is nothing like y you know in the other stuff there are yeah concave. so i think we can put um the single curved in the sixteen. that makes uh seventeen. and what are just the bt buttons, we have twelve buttons, are you sure? yeah. so i had a bad uh bad estimation. no no no. yes, a kind of scroll wheel. okay, so based on that, yeah, um where is the es okay sample speaker but still, yeah it no we cannot, yeah. so but the um yeah but if you have the near the l_c_d_ you can um choose select between um you know like uni universal between audio, t_v_ and v_c_r_, and this needs a needs a advanced chip. right, matthew? or regular chip? i think yeah regular, today we you can do that with regular chip. yeah. okay. okay. so. and what about the number of buttons buttons uh my matthew? when you look at this w, this u uh item, but you cannot make a phone to your boss saying twelve fifty is really really low, no? and uh we don't want to to change that right? we we really want a l_c_d_ other otherwise we w wouldn not get the market. it's evident. yeah. and i dunno so wha what what each of us think about the because it's measure point the l_c_d_, um do you think it's important? because sometimes whe when you watch the t_v_ in fact, you have a big display and maybe you don't need one more in your hands? i dunno, i'm just asking. yeah, it's true yeah. but uh, do we want that? on the market point of view, yeah. what do you think uh, l_c_d_ is a major feature, or? you assume, you want a democratic voyt vote, right? okay. okay. we need to be. yeah.. yes. because one yeah th show me that uh actually we could in fact we move these three buttons and have three uh possibilities for each of the three here. here one, at the middle, and at the bottom. okay,. okay. the speech recognition is out. because of the budget, yeah. yes. yeah. actually yeah, we we we will not need the really uh expert designers um because the amount, yeah. thanks.
or browse. mm. now we are supposed to give some oper offers right now. i yeah. l_e_d_. mm-hmm, hmm. also so you have uh uh browsing the channels, actually so you can go up and down the channels, uh, if you have a video or something you can forward, back. oh no no no, this is a single this this is a model with just the t_v_ one. no no just sorry, this is a standard t_v_ one, we are not talking about that. so and then we have usually there twelve keys but we know that we rel that we have only ten digits. the extra two are for uh having or giving an option for uh having more than one channel. and the other one is for the teletext or something you want to browse through from that. actually. it's a very basic minimal thing which you can which is which is also available in the market, actually that's what it that it i and would cost us to build it about eight euros. yeah. yeah. so this one model and uh yeah. sure. th this is a magic one but i know we don't want to talk about that, you know like uh i i i it is a very futuristic, it's like uh it's like a brain machine interface and all this stuff we are thinking about in the future, it can come. so that uh then what we look t yeah. this is a model, yeah. yep. uh so well then the this is the a more a little uh smooth and it gives a lot of functionality, uh in this way, so all we have uh th you see there are only six keys, but don't worry they are ma they are doing the job of twelve keys actually here. and so they have more space actually and uh it's easy to uh use this and uh you have um so this is a standard uh uh infrared eye, and then you have a power button, which l volume, what you have, and then other than that you have uh channel up and down and uh f slow pause or s slow lo yeah s pause or stop, and uh then uh you can uh you have a l_c_d_ display, here and uh y this is a functional thing which can change like it's a toggle switch which could change the function say, y you press it yeah. i really can change it, so instead of having many switches, y the l_c_d_ can display what is that on that, and uh well you can have a integrated microphone over here, or in the button th here, so which can uh basically you want to do a speech recognition and uh that channel a lot of information can be di displayed here directly on the um on your on your display. and here is a small l_e_d_ which is like blinking one, which tells you like uh are you running out of the battery, and which is can be useful for the locating as i was talking earlier okay. and uh well then we have a cover basically, basically you don't need much of the time this, when you need you can use it, and this gives additional functionality that tomorrow you want you can add a tactile thing to this cover you know. design enter. yeah. yeah. it's basically to do that. actually when you are watching the t_v_, when you are watching anything or listening to them, you hardly care about what is getting displayed here, you know, uh you want to uh and this gives a protection to the l_c_d_ actually, giving a cover to that actually. gives a protection because when it falls down or something it it is it is is is it gives a protec it's more robust that way. uh yeah. and you have very good chances yeah. yeah. it sixteen euros. yeah. three euros. part of that. yeah. well uh if you we can have if you have new more ideas we can add new more uh some more keys if you want to you know yeah it it should not be cluttering up everything. ah that's for the it's kind of a l_e_d_ for indicating your battery and as well as it's like a blinking one you know you can keep it aside. yeah. and now it easy to use. no. mm yeah. well i will give it maybe we have anyways the way we have designed it's like the surf as you say you know. it though the look is fine but uh still i will give four in that case you know. four yeah that yeah. i will gi yeah. no. c can you get the batteries? no no the battery has fallen down, that's i yeah. no no it's not that, it's how to close a battery. okay? now it should be. is there another battery there? oh yeah. no actually this is this is not going to protrude actually, it it's n i it is jus it's a led actually which which 'll be covering in a curve it's will be embedded there so it won't be really you know protruding or something. yeah. yeah. yeah. no you it it not protruding actually, it will go in better into that uh it's fine i think. my just that um the feel is that um you right now you you don't see the feel because right uh for example if you press it quite inside now like this, now it's embedded one. this is how embedded one will yeah. it's a bas basically the same thing actually. you will be except that in this c yeah. and you might have a slight thing for to forward and yeah, yeah. yeah. looking like no but except for the design of the surf. you should be rea uh no i think it's more of the feel. yeah, yeah. yeah. say about that. yeah. yep. yeah, it gives it yep. no, we ha yeah, eight euros yeah. sixteen euros. it's a two, i would say two. yeah. okay yeah. uh he is used to it act they are used to it actually. here there may uh, though it has more functionality i think it shouldn't be for the user to learn it actually. it shouldn't be diffi uh yeah, actually in fact i think it will be yeah yeah but y well we have reduced the keys actually you see. three is fine with me. yeah it's a actually the user has to put some effort to do use that actually, it's not so easy, like this one the normal. is quite easy yeah. initially there there is a lot of effort, yeah. mm. oh no, this would i i would i would give this model to the old people actually. yeah. and oh yeah,. i well i think yeah. uh yeah but but if you sell it in the market it's going to be cheap, actually. so and people can still decide to use the cheaper one instead of a okay. okay. so in that case well it's fine then. we can yeah. and the demographics of yeah i think it's uh it has more market actually. y yeah, you know two. yeah two yeah. because tomorrow this will be more appealing because you can add lot of sophistication on that. because then you you have it uh d you have lot of things which you can include for the people to we have to practically test it. the field test will tell you how good. the trends. mm-hmm. yeah i know. yeah. we we we we we yeah, it's the way they are going to be, actually. but why do you want to cover that actually? in that uh w in the mod uh uh y are you sure? yeah i think yeah it should be possible like what we do with the mobile phone, yeah. yep. yeah, it's one. yeah, it says a one point six, one point one point eight yeah. four point uh four point two. wow. yeah. yep. maybe we ought to reconsider everything with this, yeah. mm-hmm. yeah, it migh it it'll need uh more than a conventional one, it won't be uh just maybe you might use a a_a_ battery actually. what do you say, mael? yeah. curved. double curved yeah right. it's uh are you talking about this or that? mm-hmm. yeah. a special colour? uh ah good. yeah, we might need a scroll wheel, right, for that? no, for that one also. yeah that's a scroll. yeah, one scroll wheel you might need. uh bad estimate, right? that is the sample sensor and sample speaker. we just need that actually. we need one. s oh i i it i think it's going to be y y yeah it's th with the regular chip, yeah. yeah. uh yeah. that'll be then we have uh have to ask the user to press it several times. uh or we could even replace them by buttons actually. a actually it depends, it depends what kind of functionalities you want to add into it, for example if you add two more functionalities then better you add two more buttons, or and you'll have l_c_d_ display which is that is going to bring the cost by two two euros at least. okay so we can get rid of it and then add a couple of buttons. i think but yeah but the only thing is that what is the multiple functionalities you want to include with that. yeah. w i i i just yeah. that will create another problem. for the people to use it. it's not going to be easy. doing that. no, it's okay, you uh cut the l_c_d_ screen and introduce two more buttons. yeah. yeah. okay. that's it. cool.
