okay. could could i see the scroll bar as uh as as a sort of shortcut? a a and the voice recognition as well, th maybe you could uh could uh yeah. okay. okay, good. and and the case is is rubber? and the buttons? okay, and uh the colouring? with with grey or black. okay, we'll we'll come to that later. um okay. anything else to add or yeah. m uh yeah. m m but maybe you do want a programme button to uh for example activate the voice recognition, or train the voice voice recognition. yeah al although by pressing the button for i n don't know two, three seconds, you could also say it you'd disable it with a little beep and and but o okay, that that's not really really important. the basic okay. okay. um you thought of some evaluation crit criteria? okay. you are nameless. no. okay, so this these are the cr uh the criteria. okay, well the then we'll switch to my presentation. um the production costs. the costs are not under can i um this is the yeah, it's it's w way above um uh above the the the twelve euro fifty. and what makes it very expensive is uh for example the solar cell. so i guess we should skip that, because it's not that important. yeah, the the price, the the number of items and the the sum. um well, this is what i would call our luxury model. um if you would if you look at the uh w w w what we could do to make it more um to make it just between the twelve euro fifty, um then i did the following changes. twelve euro forty cents i came up with by leaving out the solar cells, um by not using the voice recognition feature, because it's uh it's a four euro uh addition to the price. um yeah, i believe uh, push-button, well it makes it the thirteen yeah. push-buttons are buttons are are not the most expensive, but do add extra cost. so um yeah, th this design is not um within our price model. um yeah. it's still too expensive, yeah. um i i guess if we leave the if we leave this one out, um oh. and uh maybe not use the special form. it becomes a very dull remote control, i know. but it's the board decision. um and um yeah. yeah. yeah, i know. maybe we should look at an uh focus on another uh yeah, m uh maybe not not all that fancy, but just way way more easy uh uh um basic and uh m maximise the profits and um yeah. yeah. i know, i know. yeah. although i think we yeah, but we could still make uh a remote control that ap uh um applies um more to young people uh by giving it another colour already. um so it is possible to make uh uh a device that attracts a little bit more to young people. um but uh i agree it's it's not a fancy high-tech uh device. definitely not, no. it's not that innovative. or however you s pronounce that. um so, okay. um oh, this is the wrong one. so uh that means redesign. we do not have the time o uh now to to redesign the product. um but we can evaluate the process and um uh uh the satisfaction on how things went. um i'm not sure if we need to evaluate uh the device first. i guess yeah. yeah, that's true. we l we can learn. yeah. yeah. i agree. well i d it is it is yeah, i think so. you like the rubber, uh roo. yeah. no, i'll i'll i'll give it a two. you like tita that's a flavour as well. right. um yeah, i know, but but it but that's fancy in the way um i mean fancy has has a lot of yeah. yeah. it applies. it yeah. yeah. yeah, i i agree. well, with the voice recognition feature and uh no, we are evaluating this this uh design now. this prototype. yeah. that would have been a thrill. yep. i'm not sure. i'm not sure. yeah. yeah. uh i'm doubting doubting as well. um yeah. okay. uh two or three? three? wha wh what would be your guess? i mean ease of use um does not only apply to the most basic functions. it's the uh it's it's overall. is the device easy to use? yeah. yeah. um okay. uh roo, a three? ruud? okay. so i could make it e easy? roo. no, i haven't said anything yet. okay, but if i would say a three, then it's six, and four is ten. divided by four is two point five. but i'm filling in a three. does it will so it will be a two point five. yes, it is. i have a veto. exactly. it's not about the content, it's about okay, um is it easy to f yeah, definitely. yeah, or beeps or yeah. i'm here, i'm here. yeah. yeah. yeah. well, i uh we should not uh stay too long on this subject uh because of the time, but i personally give it a one. um sebastian? right, well. the feel of the remote control is spongy. well, uh it can't be more spongy. so no okay, but but for the options given, it's the most spongy one. yeah. yeah. they're out there. yeah. i'll give it a one. yeah, i know, but you have to name a fig uh a number. because we need to go on in for the time. you are okay. the remote control offers enough features. well, ruud, what what do you think about it? yeah. yeah, i know. what what we didn't talk about is um uh i think it has. yeah. bec because you can um we didn't talk about it, but you do have uh remote controls that are able to adapt another signal. so, you place a a regular uh remote control in front of the other one, hit the one or the two or the three, whatever, and it r records the uh the um the the signals. so you could uh uh uh enter any comment you like, as long it's able to as long as our device is able to reproduce the infrared signal. so i think th this uh this is uh a a remote control with a very high level of features. although there are i a few buttons, but the inside is is quite uh advanced. yeah. yeah. yep. yeah. okay, um let's give it a number. i'll give it uh a one. for for the for this t uh type of market, i think it's a one. yeah. so high quality, low acceptance. the product is is is uh b high qua uh has a high quality and and is uh advanced. but whether or not our clients are are um willing to pay twenty five euros for this kind of device is doub is well, is not sure. d do you agree? yeah. maybe we should have a radar uh function. twenty five euros. yeah. mm-hmm. bu but well yeah, i know, but you're paying for th for the brand, because there are uh remote controls which control your stereo, television, d_v_d_, c_d_ player, for under twenty five euros. yeah.. yeah. okay. um you had an overall rating. um that's counting. okay. okay. um we'll go further on with the the rest of the evaluation. about the project itself, not about the product. um what did you think about uh the process, the project process? ruud? try to translate that. any any other uh, roo? roo. yeah. better decision. yeah. less. yeah. so we could we we could be we could've been creative. but um it was tempered by the choice of components and the the price. yeah. yeah. okay, roo? any other thoughts on that? ruud? you agree, okay. uh leadership. okay, roo's on for his promotion. okay. i think so too, it's it's it's uh of course a laboratory environment. i missed it um to be able to contact you in between and uh say uh, hey roo uh. um yeah. so um yeah, but but si uh w w w when taken in account the the situation, uh i think we performed pretty well. yeah. um the means, the smartboard, the digital pen. did you like 'em? because of the response or okay. uh okay, so it it had to be um better aligned, or what's the word? uh yeah. it it was calibrated just before this meeting. uh the one before, the third meeting. so uh it's not the calibration, it's the thing itself, i think. uh ruud, w uh did you use the pen a lot? or not at all? not at all. okay. i thought it was quite a handy uh thing, although i would like to see um o_c_r_. yeah. to digitise them. yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah. i know. yeah. okay. um what w uh ruud, what did you think about the smartboards? yeah. okay, you can't really decide. no. i missed a feature to easily select uh a slide and uh distribute it to the laptops. i think that would be very easy if you could say okay, i want to use this for my own work or my own presentation further on or or the other way around, that you could show but m i know. i know, but i know, but we couldn't use that feature, so i missed it. we weren't able to do that. at least the um i wasn't explained how to do such a th okay. yeah. okay, so y it it's not even as advanced as paint. yeah. okay. uh no. yeah, the project is evaluated. um but, well, we need to redesign uh the product. celebrate. okay. um you're dismissed. no, i think we are uh ready. private room, roo. that sounds quite scary. no, let's find uh the way to.. i don't believe so. well, maybe we'd get an email. thank you for your forty minutes. a minute or or ten maybe. m yeah, ten or five. so, we can uh redesign our uh uh i would like to oh. yeah. yeah. it's blue tongue. yeah. this is a new model. but blue tongue. it's spongy.. that is uh it's a new feature next to bluetooth to um disable all bluetooth devices. um yeah, we're done here. gentlemen, thank you for your cooperation. yes.
that's the same as uh on the top of it uh with the the round uh button. but uh we don't uh we don't uh we do think it's um well what if with ease of use, w which prefers the which the the customer of the user prefers. plastic or rubber. well, yeah. and a button for disabling the voice recognition. yeah. that's the basic idea, yeah. of our prototype. so just walk through it step by step. i mean, is it fancy, everything i believe uh i believe it's fancy. oh, sorry. twenty two. yikes. why does the price and and the s oh, one uh exa yeah. the number of uh yeah. and and does it but that's that's only for the buttons. so the button we can use plastic. and the pla uh and a plastic b just plastic buttons, a plas uh instead of rubber. yeah, too bad. mm-hmm. um the yellow rubber, i think so. i'm into it. it's trendy trendy, fun yeah. well, just give it a two. it's not the ultimate uh fancy two, but yeah, but that's sti that's uh looking at the user uh needs, we only uh don't we don't have the double-curved case. we w we do have uh the rubber, we do have the colours. that's two out of three. so i believe uh we are close uh to two. but that's not in it. ov or can we okay. and the scroll uh wheel. the solar not many remotes have the solar, i think. yeah. well yeah, the voice recognition of course is hard to learn, i think. well, hard it's not for the for the e for the elderly. they won't use it. i think i think a three. wouldn't give it more. yep. if you make it a four it will be three in general. if he makes it a four. not a three. darn. nee. a seven, a three no. a four and a three together. yeah, you have a two, he has a two. three? and a three? nee. i know. yes. so if you want to have the conclusion as a three three. then you would make a four. if you fill out a four yeah, we haven't re uh re uh really worked it out, but you c you can you can just say find and he repeats find. yeah, but that's the that's the the basic idea of the the speaker uh but even without it yeah. me too. was it one of our options? so, in the in yeah. but i think in this case in this case we've done the best we could. i wan i'll take one. it will be a one. yeah, but it ha doesn't has the digits. i believe it's if you uh ask yourself it offers enough features, i don't i don't think it is it has all the features um a normal remote has. yeah. i'll give a two. but we could couldn't uh what what's the selling price? fifty? uh twenty five. and costs were twelve fifty. but even now, if only our production costs w uh were exceeded the double, think. production cost was were t uh was twenty two? so uh selling price uh would be uh yeah. that's price, but w w no. an original remote control of any t_v_ kind, uh a phillips remote control, y you pay uh yeah, i kn i know uh from a few years ago, it it it costed hundred gilders. four six seven eight. nine divided by six. hmm. yeah, i think uh the process was good. but w um we weren't aware of the prices of the costs. and and that was the the big deal. i if we knew that before, we c we could have made the the choice between what yeah. no, no. fantastic. yeah. yeah. yeah. response and uh it it has yeah. yeah, it's not accurate. the p the pointing of the pen is not um the place where it it writes its um uh where it uh yeah, where it draws. it's uh the drawing on on the b on the board is r right from the pen. so uh you to take in account that your you m yeah uh it's too slow hmm. yep. if it has o_c_r_, uh i think uh i would use, but uh i i just uh took notes for myself and and and that's it. it w it w yeah. it was necessary for me to uh yeah, because if i want something on the computer, i just type it. i type faster than i write. so economic. yeah. but y you can if you save this image, you can open it in your shared work folder. so it's almost yeah. yep. mm-hmm.. a and the function of of filling an an uh an oval or an an object. i it's not possible yeah. oh it looks like paint actually. great. it was a privilege working with you. to private rooms? but you see the problem, y you can't continue your uh your line. well, it's fluffy alright. spongy. a giraffe? right.. leave it here. that's alright.
like this one. it's important. uh i think th this is device which which has a learning curve. um novice users u use this device as uh normal users use uh a c a remote control. and after a while they start to develop uh some skills in the the voice recognition functions, and then they will not use this dial as often. but other users who are new to this device need something like that. they n they need to understand what uh how to change channels and uh change the volume, so it's easier for them yeah, maybe so. yes, it's well, it's it's it's another approach, it's more that our um. there are there are many ways of doing uh things uh on such a device. it's it's quite easy. yes, rubber? there are plastic or rubber. uh yellow with uh grey or black or something like that. whatever cost uh cost uh the least. no. uh maybe we should uh think about these buttons. but yes, but it but these are tasks that are only executed once, i think. or not? well okay. okay, yeah, that's right. or something li like that. yes. is it spongy? i believe it's fancy too. okay. well it's very expensive. okay. okay. mm-hmm. mm-hmm. hmm. okay. but i'm afraid it's not complete. because we use spec uh specic uh special materials, the last item. and you have not added one item there. so it's c way too expensive. but it yes. well, b basically it when when this is our only option, we should even consider changing the casing, because i think there's very little added value in uh an enhanced case with these dull functions. so type of m maybe another market segment. yeah. yes. that's maybe that's better. maybe we could uh we should go for straight and simple, but that's not what uh has been asked. so we should kick the board's uh well hmm. yes. well, maybe it's good to do it anyway, because if we evaluate it, we we can also determine if our objectives are good. so is it fancy? i think so. but it's not that fancy. i mean i think uh i think it would have been more fancy if we used the titanium housing the casing. it would be even more oh, you really like titanium. i'm i'm into it. it has flavour. yes, that's right. you should taste it. it has to do with fashion, i guess. so do okay. yes. i think i th i think it would have been i would have think uh it could have been more fancy by using the double-curved case. it would have been even more fancy, but we decided not to, because if we use a double-curved case, we could not use solar. so yes. yes, i agree too. it's okay. we did yes, we did good. well, let's let's this product. so i i i think it is. i think it's innovative. no. it could have been a little bit more innovative u by using the kinetic uh energy source, but it's it's way too yes, but i think uh it's a two. well, but there are two parts in this remote control. what you see here is is the basic part. everybody can use it, so that's easy to use. that's for a novice user. when you have a more advanced, elaborate user, well, such a user really would like to explore all these additional functions. so in that in that way it is advanced, and i think it's easy to use for for both uh types of users. so uh it's maybe it's not very uh easy for okay. yeah, that's right. you're right in that, but i i guess uh an advanced user will will find the voice recognition function easy to use, because he is already he or she is already an advanced user. so after all, i think personally i would give a two. but so, it's two, two and three. two threes. so that's ten. so that's w no, two and a half. six and four. six and four is ten. divided by four is two and a half. so yes. four? two? divided by four. that's not even but that's not possible to fill in, so we have to round it. yes. it it most definitely is it's very easy. yes. maybe uh i i think i think something like that. maybe you have to uh programme it once, so to that l respond to uh a certain word or a certain sentence, something like where are you, and then it will sing i'm here. so something like that. so, i th yeah, me too. well, it can be. there are cases um in which the outside casing is um can be uh how d how do you prono is is moldable. no, it's not one of our option, but when you look in the market, when you look uh yes, but that's not that's not uh what they are talking about, i think. because we compare all these uh characteristics characteristics with uh market uh with with the real market. so there are uh remote controls out there which are a lot more spongy. they're out there. yes, but it's not good enough, so it's a two. you take one? what do you give it? no no no. uh i'll i'll change it, i'll make it m my my mark will be a four. basically it's it's completely programmable. you can add very m much functionality by uh using the voice recognition mode. so it's quite advanced. yes. has uh the signals sent to it. absolutely. yes. but that that's its power, i guess, because uh a regular programmable uh remote control contains, well, uh really a lot of buttons. at at least uh forty buttons. so it's it's quite s complicated to get uh to get used to. and this is quite s simple. you can use your voice to to programme it. it's yeah, i'll give it a one. yes. i i've i think we've uh succe succeed in in developing a product that's actually quite good, but not for this kind of market, and not for this kind of price. so hmm. yes. mm-hmm. mm-hmm. yes, i agree. i yeah, okay. but yes. m about fifty euros. that's quite ex well, it's not it's not very expensive for a remote control that that has this functionality. yes, it's more than fifty euros. it's quite expensive, yes. yes. yes, but you can you c yes, but you can learn this thing, all these functions. and it's easier to use because those uh remote controls don't offer voice recognition and this one does. so i think it's worth its price. well, it's it's about one point five. something like that. well well, i think mm. actually, we had yes. we had we had too little information actually. so and uh um the the the well, looking at room for creativity, there was w way too the the choice of components was way too narrow. so there was not really a process of uh well yes. well, in the first meeting we we already were very creative. we we thought of possibilities who are not possible uh with the the current uh offer of uh manufacturing components. so we're tempered by that, yes. yeah, okay. i think we're a good team. yes. well, i tried once, but that was not allowed. i think so too. uh. the digital pen was okay, but smartboard was really bad. it it's the response is very slow and the possibilities are very limited. it's not accurate. maybe it's it needs to be calibrateds. it is? okay. okay. i i think so too. yes. yes. mm-hmm. but i think it's a great solution for uh for uh a known problem, uh writing down some notes, some some inf uh information, and then um forgetting your notebook somewhere and losing all that information. because you have everything in one place and it's quite easy quite easy it's it's possible to make this information digital and share it with others in a quite easy way. i think it's a good product. i only think it's th the the shape of the pen is too big. it's not quite uh ergonomic. eco ergonomic. yes. yes, yes. that's quite what powerpoint does. an object, yes. yes. the drawing cap capabilities are very limited. and and uh w you were when you're using uh windows, you're used to a certain interface and certain buttons, uh which you can use for drawing. and a lot of these buttons don't appear here. so it's not not uh n not way. it's quite uh limited. okay. oh, very good, celebration. pop uh pop up the champagne. okay. i see some action over there. okay. uh we're done, we're finished, i believe. so, are there any more cycles in this process? i think not. but um how much time did we get for this meeting? and how much time is left? ten minutes. okay. okay. well, i think we we we all know what the redesign should be. a simple, dull, uh one-coloured box. no, it's it's just the same product that is already on the market. what is that? it's a giraffe eating a eating leaves from a tree. so you're actually promoting bluetooth. or blue tongue. blue tongue. okay. let's wrap it up. thank you mister manager. now, let's have uh a bottle of champagne..
well, you could use two of them to programme the um channels on the two channel button, 'cause you have to assign two channel new channels. you yes. uh my name is not name but uh well, i used the the uh documents. and these uh were the most important criteria. it should be. yeah, that's uh how the fashion guys uh state it. fancy look and feel. so uh well appar yeah, but apparently uh we shouldn't evaluate yet. so yeah, i think these are the most important criteria. so uh that's about it. um well, since we're not gonna manufacture it anyway uh yay. is it? is it fancy? so uh one? is it uh and w yeah, w what they want wanted was uh colours and soft materials. so in that way it it's fancy. okay, and uh was it innovative? yep. yeah, and uh so uh also a uh two? is it easy to use? well the p the most important function is easy to use. the the zapping, channel switching, volume. but the more advanced functions are probably a bit harder. good question. uh i'll go uh for the two. hmm? huh? yeah. i yeah. yeah, two, two, three no. is it easy to find? yeah, i agree. no. uh this this was a most spongy option. well yeah, it depends, 'cause it's the most spongy we could but yeah. well, if i give it a one there'll be one hell of a calculation. so i'll just give it a two and make this a one point five. well, the basic layout doesn't offem offer much, but the voice recognition could add a lot. so yeah, depends. uh depends on what you uh implement in the speech feat signal. um i think think a one, 'cause v with a voice recognition you could add anything you want, so that's like um maybe even because it doesn't look advanced. yeah, but uh with these ratings uh should be about one point s seven, yeah. ye the prices. i agree. draws. no. not really. oh, i only use it to draw a rabbit, so can't say much about it. no, or the other way around. yeah. and no added value. at all. so in interesting design. oh uh it it does uh have a natural uh feeling. so yeah..
