wonder how much of the meetings is talking about the stuff at the meetings. yeah. not a lot. no. hmm. okay. sounds like you've done some stuff. so 'kay. hmm. hmm. everything. yeah. hmm. yeah. yeah. yeah. to just have the sort of main same sort of idiom throughout kinda. so hmm. yeah. hmm. yeah. yeah. but then it's not as extensible. like if we wanna add more things in the future, then we have to well, new buttons. i don't know. whereas a menu type thing is more flexible that way. but we're probably not gonna be adding too many things. okay, exactly. i know, i know. true, true. yes. hmm. hmm. yeah. actually, yeah, but maybe tie that in with dialogue acts or something as well. i mean speaker characterisation tied into i don't know. di just some way to sort of leverage that information. like we have it, we're doing it, but what how does it help the browsing? or what can it give us in the browsing? yeah. yeah. hmm. right. yeah. true, yeah. is that just from the main main window? is that is that from any particular window, like if we wanna sorta get like if we were on the users versus like topic or something, have a right-click from for these various things to yeah. right, yeah. yep. okay, yeah. now it's consistent throughout. so, yeah. right. actually yeah, like um another common thing, like if we have it so it's set up that um if you double-click and it goes to a default thing on the menu, i mean that's kind of a typical kinda action that would happen. if you double-click on a particular topic or something, then it goes to sort of a like a default view, so it'll be like all the um cases of that topic, either whatever we decide the default to be, whether it's in all meetings or just in one meeting, and just show up the the particular instances of that topic in a meeting. like i'm just thinking to have the default there, so if somebody knows exactly what they wanna do and we know that that's the most common thing that's gonna happen, so the double-click will do that and so save them the trouble of right-clicking and choosing the item on the menu. well, it might come to us as we start playing with it. um like we have the the right-click menu. you'll have the menu, right-click it, but instead of like have a default double-click, so if there's a de so it'll be a choice from the menu but yeah, exactly. yeah. yeah. hmm. yeah. yeah. hmm. yeah, exactly. well then they close it. yeah. you know, it's not it's not the end of the world. yeah,. yeah. okay.. hmm. mm. well, yeah. mm-hmm. i think we probably need that, though to have the f the full flexibility, we need to have that there, but um yeah. mm-hmm. although the thing is typically though, is someone gonna have five windows open at the same time, probably not. probably just two or two or three of whatever whatever they're looking at, like dialogue acts, to whatever, characterisations. hmm. yeah, true. hmm. so like have a tab there? for something like that choose on choose one. yeah. oh you should be able to. yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah, or even just have buttons on it, toggle buttons or something on the tool-bar for that window. just something. a lot of different ways we can do it, it doesn't doesn't have to be a tab or whatever. just gonna be yeah. yeah. yeah. exactly. or check-marks. even have two of 'em checked and send yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah, exactly. yeah. mm-hmm. yeah. true. oh yeah? okay. yeah. yeah, like a lot of these can be, like once we get the disfluencies out, then we can you know, have transcript without the disfluency, transcript with the disfluent disfluency. have all these, you know, have all these sort of using the same window and so we can put a lot of and probably mutually um whate distinct, yeah. exclusive, yeah. yeah. hmm. right. yeah, that kinda makes sense. by the end of february. okay, right. yeah. yeah. mm-hmm. yeah. yeah, so we can plug it in and hmm. mm-hmm. hmm. actually is the code accessible, like the the gui stuff that you've done, yeah. like can we just like copy like the latest stuff out of your directory, somewhere? or like if we're gonna just try and like take a look or something, try and just plug some stuff i think you can if well, if you just tell us the directory and just make the file readable, then we c know the directory to get in then and just that might be might be an idea. yeah. i think by default they are i think really? or yeah. okay. okay, alright. okay. or you could just email to us. okay, yeah, yeah, okay, right. yeah, right, okay. okay. yeah. yes. lower case. yeah. hmm. right. um all the searching stuff. like the the in inverted file stuff and um the next search query and all that. hmm. yeah. so you could probably just use that code, like that was behind the question she asked him earlier. just you know, the re-using code and stuff was just like okay, good. um apparently yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah, probably. we'll probably still have to do some other file manage while, i don't know, creation. messing around still, though. yeah. yeah. yeah. um hmm. yeah. huh? okay. right. okay. right. yeah, it's good idea. yeah. mm-hmm, libraries. hmm. right. yeah. yeah. yeah, exactly, exactly. so you're still working? i see. yes, exactly, same. yeah, i mean betwe um i sup yeah. yeah. right. well well you're in s_p_n_l_p_ and s_p_ two, right? so yeah. yeah, that's where i'm at. hmm. yeah. yeah, oh yeah. yeah, that's fun. oh yeah. okay. so. yeah, i was thinking that we can probably get uh start attacking this seriously and then just um, yeah, hopefully have something by next week that we can sorta try integrating into the gui. okay. think that should be possible. okay. why? hmm. well they did say it wasn't the most efficient. very clearly, yeah. yeah. yeah. okay. hmm, right, right. yeah. m yeah. yeah. hmm. yeah, seriously, on the weekend. yeah. well f uh um yeah. yeah. how many hours is this? hmm. yeah, seriously. hmm. yeah. yeah. that's what i gotta work on. mm. who was doing that? oh really? damn. yeah, yeah. these can be changed as well. okay, yeah. um i don't know, it doesn't matter. if if you want to. i mean it's just, you know, play around with some extra stuff. you have some time, why not. hmm. was that in informatics course? or oh. oh, it like digital, okay. okay. yeah. hmm. alright. yeah. fine. hmm. yeah. i'll be happy when this week is over. yeah. well i don't know, is that about it then or anything else we need to discuss? did we wanna meet before we talk to steve next week. well, i dunno. we'll probably get some work done over the weekend, so i dunno if after d_n_l_g_ or something, maybe just have a little quick little update and just yeah. well we can decide. yeah, exactly. true. yeah. search. and well sure, why not. couldn't be that hard. well, it'll be, you know, still limited version of, you know, the next query search. but, no no. won't be the whole thing then. um like we can just decide sort of things that we do wanna do. hmm. yeah. well, actually most are just dialogue acts. and what else was there.. summary topic yeah. yeah. yeah, it'll get behind schedule, yeah, pretty quick. like you're saying, yeah. well actually, do we wanna set a date for interim prototype? specifically a date? yeah. okay. is it semblance of reality. yeah. i see. right, true. mm decide on that on over the weekend. yeah. right. yeah, totally. oh, just like the basic. so like no. sorry? yeah. just like all the and seeing the code, and just sort of how just see the basics of what you've done. like just get a a quick look over and just the basics. yeah. or like like, you know, the class paths all that sort of thing. like just just say okay, well here's you know, everything's basic in set-up and then just yeah, just jump right in. yeah. yeah. that's cool. yeah. in the morning. yeah. yeah. yeah, i know. well thing is, you know, if yeah, something like that could happen anytime 'cause uh yeah, like my schedule's like a class, break, class, break, class, you know, that sort of thing. so so yeah, i know, exactly, exactly, that's what i'm thinking. so something like that and then if i have a class i can run off and do whatever. yeah. okay. actually monday, monday might be good d um. yeah, yeah. anytime um, not at n not at noon or two or four. no, in between those is you know, like one or three or sure. possibly. yeah. yeah, that's an option too. yeah, after. sure. that's fine. yeah. or three thirty. no, just yeah. that'd be necessarily necessarily short. actually we can't get in there though. w we well we can get in through the through the the card the card door. yeah. how about if we take uh a tour? yeah, right. yeah, yeah, exactly. okay. just sort bang on it. actually i was asking steve about that, whether we can get in there. whether he was gonna get us access into the the computer room. yeah, print okay. right. is there a printer in there too? a nice okay. that would come in handy, yeah. hey, we could we could photo-copy our um assignment if we wanted to. yeah. well the comments i'm thinking. um yeah, that's true. so after d_n_l_g_. yeah. as long as d_n_l_g_ doesn't go late. oh. so sounds like me. are you? next week? or the week? how? oh. yeah. that's cancelled? oh really? hmm. um something like that. i think one or couple classes were cancelled. yeah. exact yeah. i th yeah. i think it was up to the professor whether they did it or not. well, i don't feel like teaching. yeah, okay. i think yeah. i think d_i_l_ will probably have one to make up for missing classes. d_i_l_ will probably have classes, yeah. yep. you can have it. yeah. huh? which one, the top one? um do you really want multiple windows from a single lap? but most will probably want to go with defaults. yeah. yeah. you'd be s yeah, exactly, and just the other comment about whether you wanna do both speaker characterisation and topic segmentation. yeah, yeah that's about it. nothing terribly exciting. okay. yeah. alright. okay. so okay. yeah. okay.
okay. so what do we need to talk about? yeah. uh yeah. good start. oh, i don't mind as well. this wasn't a good start. okay. sorry. yeah. yeah. can you use double-click or yeah, i don't know. yeah. and then i guess a button button makes a bit more sense, 'cause otherwise you don't really know that, oh, what if i right-click now, what happens then? it's like more if it's visual. yeah. do you see my yeah. but well, we we can have both, but whatever. yeah, um i don't i mean it w it's more like part of the browsing sort of thingy. more than the speaker characterisation, as m steve mentioned. um, i don't really know how to involve the speaker characterisation into the browsing. yeah, well yeah. i mean i guess maybe we could have that as another thing of like, well if you get the speaker characterisation that someone s talks a lot in uh a certain topic, and then if you, i don't know, click on that topic, you get everything that's in that topic or whatever. and in that way but i don't know. no no no. yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah. uh just let th yep. yeah. like, i don't know, show the speaker characterisation for instance. or just i don't know. but if you do double-click on something, don't you expect something to happen then? sort of well, i don't know. yeah. yeah. yeah, uh that was good start. i don't know. i guess it depends on the yeah, what you're clicking on. obviously. single channel. no. no. yeah. but uh well, couldn't we i mean you probably i don't know if you wanna have like the the full transcription and the summary at the same time. so maybe you can just like choose the s same window for transcription and summary. yeah. yeah. tabs are nice. i like tabs. yeah. i don't know how easy it is. but i dunno, but yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah. or just, i don't know. yeah, uh change the contents of the same window, like from transcription to summary. probably yeah. hmm. yeah, yeah. that could probably no, no, it could be like transcription summary, like two buttons and you just press on which ever you want. yeah. yeah. i don't like pop-ups. i guess that yeah. yeah. he's close. yeah, um well could uh i don't know. would transcripts uh b sounds reasonable to have like transcripts like maybe three alternatives then. like full meeting, meeting without disfluencies, and summarise. yeah. um yeah. i guess it is. i mean just to try it and i mean for us to to be able to do something that we can include with your thing so so eas yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah. just so see the integration works sort of between the different compo um so i guess that's what we need to aim for. yeah. yeah. well if i guess i mean that was probably our intention, but we might not have written it down. so i guess i know. yeah. yeah. alright. say that again, o_ four. oh yeah. mm. okay. i could tell you what i done in s_p_ two. oh um i don't know. i basi i s started like browsing a bit, just like trying to see if there's anything out there to use s sort of um just yeah, searching, yeah well yeah. we're doing the. yeah, yeah. so it just found a tutorial but i inverted search in indexing, but i haven't read it yet. but yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah, well i don't know if it's usable. i uh can have a look th at it. but but i found some code for like from a tutorial about i indexing. uh whatever. yeah. yeah, yeah. yeah. yeah. um yeah, i guess that's it. i don't know. uh i'm i was a bit worried about when well when he talked about this with the mm file messing around with files. i mean uh how much do we actually need to do. like extracting things from the x_m_l_ files and stuff to be able to do the indexing? okay. okay. what are you writing in java or yeah, okay. yeah. you know a bunch about file things. um yeah, i guess i mean it was a good point you had that like collaborating with the file things. i mean if you already started on on doing your stuff, i guess we can yeah. yeah. should we, i don't know, meet up and see what we could do? i mean, i don't know, see what you've done and see what we need when we know more of what we need maybe? or what do we need. yeah. yeah. yep. yeah. well yep. oh. um yeah, we're gonna meet up. yeah. 'cause it's now okay. okay. but it what what is it like a window where you have to wr write the search query? or is it just what's behind it? so or how does it work then? d okay. yeah. yeah. okay. yeah. okay. when you like you is there a open thingy or like well what did you two do to like how did you figure out that this uses n_x_t_ search like is it okay. okay. yeah. mm-hmm. yeah. oh yeah. yeah. oh no. yeah. yeah. mm. i don't know. oh. oh. yeah. yeah. that's nice. sorry. i'm just being yeah. hmm. have we these courses that we're okay. yeah. no. i don yeah. yeah, i don't know.. yeah. yeah. yeah. no. mm. i don't know. mine was the progress report is due on twenty third february. february. um yeah. yeah. yeah. just looking at my own deadlines. see. yeah, that would be fine.. wasn't like what you had now, wasn't that pretty much what we agreed on? or was it just like that one. okay. this is illusion or whatever. oh mm. nice thought. i'm impressed. maybe you should make it exist then. yeah. yeah. it would be nice to, i don't know, meet up and uh you can sort of show us a bit what you know already, so we don't sort of have to do all the work again of just like figuring out stuff. just like accessing the corpus and stuff. yeah. yeah. yeah, yeah yeah. yeah. um yeah. yeah. next yeah, this monday. just yeah. it's full, yeah. yeah. well, it doesn't matter for me. i mean three three or after what? maybe we ca in four buccleuch. we can go look we can look at now, afterwards. yeah. okay. into what? okay uh. yeah. oh, is that the photo-copier i heard i heard about? yeah. yeah. yeah. so what time do we say? yeah, yeah. yeah, yeah, yeah. okay. hmm. what? it's true. yeah, i don't know. it's reading week next. it should be it shouldn't be any well, it's supposed to be next week. it's week six next week. i don't know. we have one class at least when we like speech perception, we don't have any lectures. but i think we're having like all other classes. so uh there's not point in having no, i think it w yeah, which are a bit crap, yeah. i think the under-graduates had uh all were off totally. what? yeah, th we will probably have it, yeah yeah. last week. yeah. yeah, um i guess that's it. was there anything else? do anyone know you wanna like take care of this or should i take care of it? yeah. i don't know if there was something. oh i think he basically said um the same things as in the comments, if i could read it. can you read that? yeah. from a single application yeah. well, uh that was, i guess. oh. no. oh yeah. yeah? and now we have seven percent of the course already done? is quite good. so if y if you're okay with uh having oh. who? yeah.. we're done now. i uh is she still here? yes, you are. yeah.
yeah, exactly, yeah yeah yeah. should we well should we just go around and everyone says what they d what they've been doing, how far they've got. well i hope so. okay. well i've got a browser now, which whoops. already gone. mm-hmm. yeah. okay. so yeah. we've go a browser we've um which comes up automatically with a transcription box and the topics. and then when you go on the menu, you can select a summarisation box, which pops up, and an audio player. um and a s i think the search works as well, so you could pop up a search. and it loads up um just the background window is empty and um so when you start, you have to either open open a particular observation or do a search and open it through that. does that make sense? um the transcription box has got a summarise but button, which doesn't do anything yet. um now i wonder wh how we wanna do, you know, we want a pop-up window with the speaker characterisation. um either we could do that you know, when does the pop-up come? either we can when you click on the the i_d_, any sort of i_d_ in the transcription box, or we can put an extra button extra few buttons next to the summarise button so that you actually in the transcription box, but so like you click on a button and then that opens whatever that speaker characterisation is. the problem is the r the left-click is already used because it highlights that um that part of speech or whatever that what he's been saying, you know, the the left-click highlights it. so that you can i don't know what happens when you double-click actually, but that'd be a bit annoying if you have left-click for one thing and double-click for something else. um i think so yeah, when you left-click it, you can for example set set the marker there so that the mm the audio goes from there, i think. um so we can't put it on left-click. we could put it on a right-click. we could for example have a little menu that pops up. so right-click on at menu, you know, and you can click on speaker characterisation, up pops the window. that's a good point. i don't know. nothing else. yeah, yeah, but um i don't know about you, but uh usually in windows right-click doesn't do anything, does it? it opens a menu. yeah, so yeah. so but that'd be yeah. if you just yeah. yeah. um or just, you know, or just the button. well no no, you still have the menu the menu pop up that well oh, yeah. it's more obvious, isn't it, w what you can do. yeah. yeah, that's right. that's true, yeah, it's more intuitive really, isn't it? maybe, maybe. in the beta version. um but actually what we could do is on in that menu as well we could have an option that pops up a window with all the all the meetings that that user has been in. like a search for that user. is that gonna be useful or too much? or yeah, so y when you right-click on it, one one option will be give me all your meetings, characterise the speaker or is that too much i mean? yeah. yeah, that's true, yeah. yeah. yeah, that's true. it'd nice to have it inconnec interconnected like or you mean the the speaker characterisation? oh well, yeah, i mean, i don't know about that. i mean it's the speaker characterisation is a bit like you said. i mean it's like a nice thing. we don't we're not actually sure what the user wants with it, but it's interesting, so why not give it to him. i i think we should do it. i mean yeah, i mean that's that's still another level further. i mean we're not even there yet. you know, it doesn't even doesn't even pop up the speaker characterisation yet. y we have to first define what what happens when you click on a user. yeah. yes. so should we try try to do a right-click when you then sorry? yeah. yes. wait. yeah, there's a second thing about the topics, the topic window. we wanna somehow click be able to click on a topic and it pops up with all the meetings that contain that. yeah? so we could do that in a similar way, do it right-click as well. and to have a different menu for our yeah. so yeah. so we have basically two options of of browsing the meetings is by either um searching and opening individual observations. and when then we have the interlinking by right-click basically. double-click oh. hmm. yeah. i don't see there's anything obvious that was that would be able, you know, that would be yeah, but then then there's the problem with a lot of windows popping up again. and they pop up without you even being quite sure what it is, you know what i mean? yeah, maybe. mm. hmm. especially if you have a touch-pad. it just goes oh. well i'll i'll check what it does on on um double-click at the moment. 'cause i think it might do something. but but yeah, mm but i don't i don't i d really don't see anything obvious that that would i mean if you can think of something that sorry. sorry. um yeah, another thing. single audio files. do we wanna use them or not? yeah, single channel that's single channel files. do we want them? i mean yeah, okay, yeah, yeah. i mean we might use them while wo to work with them, but do we wanna integrate them in so that when you browse you can here's do you though? i mean it's not gonna make much sense if you don't listen to it on its own d do you? does it? no, hmm. yeah. yeah. yeah. um yeah, wh what do people think in general about the windows cluttering that he's mentioned? do you think do you think it's really that bad? that's what i feel as well. i mean i'm i'm very much i w i wanna have everything customisable. um probably not, no. yeah. two or three maybe, but yeah. but yeah, it depends, i mean i i really wanna put the summary in somewhere, you know. and the summary for example is typical. you open the window, you read through it, you might click on you know, close it again straight-away. but it'd be good to have it there. i was just thinking of tab. that true. yea yeah yeah yeah. that's right. i'm not sure yeah. no. i don't know. do you reckon? i'm sure. i'm sure you could do anything. hmm. i can have a look. but yeah, that that might be an idea, yeah. hmm. but i mean people get used to it, i mean when you use a windows or linux for that matter, you have a lot of windows open. and you manage them. yeah, you can minimise 'em. yeah, yeah. yeah, that's true, they're they're definitely yeah, they're definitely gonna be in the same window, yeah. exclusive. yeah, that that was the plan for the disfluencies anyway. so d yeah, do you wanna do that with summaries in? put the summaries in in the same window. mutually exclusive with summary. yeah, you wanna do that? yeah. and finally the prototype he spoke about. what kind of prototype could we produce? because i'm i'm just, you know, i go into the lab and i say right, what am i gonna change today. you know? and it kind of just it just develops, i'm not aiming for anything. do we wanna aim for something? i'm i'm pretty much getting there anyway, to be honest. it's not it's not gonna be a lot more work. oh. hmm. mm true. oh right, i see. hmm. um probably not. i don't know, can you access other people's yeah, sure. i don't know if it's readable at the moment, but you can sure have a d have a look. alright. 'kay. right, well i'll make that readable then. um so the directory is my number well, this is not difficult. it's in all the emails. not o_ four. o_ four, five five five, six o_. o_ four five five five six o_. and then um there's a folder um n_l_s_s_d_, and it's called the m_ browser. yes, m_ for meeting. really. no, i'm i'm extremely organised, you see. i've got folders for everything. i love folders. yep, so that's me done. someone else wanna talk about their stuff? mm-hmm. w what where you doing again? the search, okay. okay. indexing. oh. oh right. oh that's pretty much there, is it? of making oh great. yeah, that's handy. so you think it shouldn't be too difficult? oh, i see. yeah. you have to convert it to some sort of format, i suppose. i mean you should look at look have a look at the the browser code then, because um, you know, they already extract for example transcripts. put it into a window at least. what do you mean? this week's only two days old. oh. yeah. oh that's complete rubbish anyway. never mind. just so stupid. mm-hmm. well ye the browser as i use it now or as uh, you know, it was there when i took it um uses the um the n_x_t_ search to get the data out of the out the files, which i think is odd, but i'm not quite sure how it works yet. i don't quite understand it. to get the data i for example to get the summarisation data, you have to search for i think the i_d_s or something. yeah. yeah. so they don't, you know, they don't say look in that and that folder, but they say search everything. oh it does load up quite quickly. so you know, it's not too bad. but you know, you could have a look at them. no, this is not the actual search. this is just when you open what you know, to load the transcript for example, to find the transcript for a certain meeting, it does does an n_x_t_ search for the string, i don't know, transcript or text or whatever. yeah. yeah, so i don't know if you've looked at the search query s language, but it's like a dollar a_ text say. yeah. and then yeah. because every every of all of these um these files have got um tha an i_d_. and all the transcript files have got the string, i don't know what it is, words or text or something in it, so it just searches for those files. vaguely. so open. um um well, it's in the code. just that it, you know, it yeah, you define a search object, and then you search on that string. i had to figure out how to how to do the same thing for the summary. that's how i i had to i had to understand how to do the transcript how they did the transcript to do the summary myself. yeah, just search for a specific string. so you could just, you know, you could use that when you if you wanna um take the data out and put it somewhere. yeah. if you have a a question about w what the p the code means or where to find the code that you wanna, you know, whatever you wanna do, then just send me an email. i can explain it. oh yeah. actually, in the moment it's got a load of rubbish because the the um the browser that i used from this from you know, that they gave us, had a lot of extra stuff in, and i haven't dared throwing out to through out all the functions i haven't you know, that i don't need. yeah, just in case. exactly. yes. so they're all in there ye still. a lot of rubbish, but they will be get will be chucked out right at the end, i think. yes. exactly, yes. yeah. precisely. the weekend? the weekend's still four days off. oh. i don't actually have that much to do at the moment. well oh dear. well i can't remember what i'm supposed to do, by the way. am i supposed to do the summarisation thingibob? no. you do. well, i'll do that then. shall i do that then? i mean or you know it shouldn't be to difficult. i mean well i'm doing communications, which we had one exercise and i've done that like two weeks ago. and that's in in two weeks. yeah, it's a nine nine course as well or ten or something. yeah. and then then i'm doing parallel programming languages and systems, which we had one exercise as well, and that's in like friday. well i'm not doing any background reading, so you know. being lazy. oh. yeah, if you like. we can always decide then, i mean yeah. yeah. um so what what are you planning to do over the weekend then? you're gonna do the search. you're gonna implement the search. everything? mm-hmm. it's just that i think we need to set ourselves some milestones, because otherwise you know weeks will go by and well you decide, i'm not doing much for that prototype. so of oh. well, how about we get it done by then? i mean then we can write about it in the in the interim report, and s you know, and then we've got something to show. um oh and the the search interface. maybe you should decide pretty pretty early what kind of things you wanna be able to search for. and then if you want, you can give that to me and i'll i'll build a u nice, you know, a few tick-boxes and drop-down menus. no. oh that's that's that doesn't exist. tha that's completely cut and pasted. that does not exist. nicely done though, isn't it? it's actually all these all these um things are are nicked from um you know, all these drop-down menus and tick-boxes are nicked from google online. a screen-shot of google. it's just so much fun. it's gonna be a little difficult more difficult. yeah, i mean i was going to, but you know, the whole drop-down menus and stuff, what we wanna search for is not quite agreed on. we never agreed on what we wanna be able to search for. so yeah, do you wanna, you know, just get together and think about the different types of search we could possibly do, and then then we could discuss it next meeting which options we really wanna include? that would probably involve researching the query language a bit as well to see what that can do. know know already what? oh. yeah. yeah. yeah, i can do that. show you what bits the code yeah. ah, yeah. well this time i'm dictating the time, 'cause i if i'm not there you can't do anything. yeah, ah it's not gonna take an hour to explain it, you know. i mean pick a time. i i you know, let me know, whenever. what monday. what did you say? three o'clock. actually th yeah. unless you wanna do it after the um after d_ d_ and a_. that's gonna be tight. yeah, it what front door? i've not found that yet. really? really? ah. well, i'm just i've got it in my computer. whatever is in my computer. i just think it's better to do it afterwards. then we have all the time we need. rather than have half an hour and then we'll surely run out. oh. actually it's not even confirmed yet. what was she doesn't even know what she's talking about yet, i think. maybe it doesn't happen at all. is it really? really? i don't think we have a reading week though. the the yeah, i don't think there is an official i don't think there was an official one last semester. i think it was just a bank holiday, wasn't it? no, okay. let's meet monday. hmm? right. i think we need to tick the okay box, right? ooh. exciting. should we turn these off then or what?
funky sh stuff like that. yeah. yeah. look at all this stuff man. okay. right. has anybody has anybody done anything? you better start. good at this. right. d yeah. the l the left-click or the right-click. right. yeah, it might be quite good, i suppose. yeah. what else could we have in the menu? okay. so otherwise you just have a right-click or do you have have a is a window. a menu, yeah yeah. yeah, it's why. and so it might be a bit weird the fir to just start bringing up stuff and then it yeah. yeah. yeah. it's more it's more idiot proof, isn't it. it's got a button. add more buttons. yeah. well in uh i guess in in in meeting browser one point one, you can have a menu instead of a button but this why i don't think it yeah. yep. i guess so. so what did you part of the m the menu that comes down, it says give me all your meetings or something. yep. i guess so. it's an idea. get to use my pen. yeah yeah. oh yeah. we have to have a speaker characterisation first before we cross any of the other bridges. so yeah, there you go. yeah. alright. why not. even if only one thing comes up. okay. so and so this lot is for um on the t speaker. and then this lot is on th what was that? i didn't quite understand. do you mean yeah. oh, so and it figures out what's the most common use to double-click. oh. okay. yeah. sometimes you do it by accident though. you, oh go away. stop coming up. yeah. no. yeah, yeah, oh yeah. t throw stuff throwing out the window. yep. we don't know yet do we, i don't think. do you mean the single channel? probably not, but we might need them for disfluencies, if we try do it in audio. but at the moment, no. but yeah. we might want to be able to say oh, just give me what that person's saying. unless um you can't hear it properly or something. somebody's talking over somebody else or something. well p w we just say no for now and put it in later or something. yeah, yeah. yeah, 'cause otherwise it will the it will increase the amount of data we need by a lot, won't it? therefore print will be bigger. yeah. no, i think it's i think it's fine. yeah. i think what we're doing is fine. yeah, tabs are good. mozilla style. yeah. does anybody know how to do that? or can you do that in java? i don't think java knows how to do that really. maybe yeah, you probably can. but but if you really knew what you're doing. but i don't know. it's a bit of a cripple with java's windowing tool-kit. the eight is sometimes it's a bit of a cripple. yeah. yeah yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah, that will reduce the number of um windows we needed, wouldn't it? which is quite good. 'cause otherwise photoshop has a lot of windows, if you ever use photoshop it's got loads, and you're always g forever going no, get out of the way. there's always stuff in the way, isn't there. so yeah. you do, yeah? yeah. yeah. unless, can you i don't suppose you can minimise them and stuff like that can you can you do that? okay, well it's alright then. yeah. of course you can actually, yeah, it's got everything. yeah, sounds good. um yeah, that's what we need, yeah. something just slightly more than just that on its own. yep. yep, definitely. i think that's kinda as well, isn't it really? seeing it seeing it sort of start to do stuff rather than just be a prototype with a gui. yeah, yeah. yeah. you can make it if you make it world readable, then anybody can access it. yeah. no, uh i i it no, they're not world-readable. it not the default they're only default then only you can read them by default. you can see them but you can't read them. yeah. what's your number? okay, your number. okay. and then it's n_l_s_s_d_. the m_ browser, for meeting. hope you hope you never have to look in my directory. it's just pure chaos. s mine is serious chaos. files everywhere. don't all jump at once. yeah. yeah, what was on it. oh you found some code for it. for the inde alright. alright. cool, cool. so even if it doesn't work, you can jiggery pokery around and make it work. y yeah. yeah yeah. all sorts of nonsense. but yeah. by the basics is uh oh okay, that's good. yeah. i've been trying to g write something to read the x_m_l_ and get rid of it. and i can get rid of it, but i'm having trouble putting it anywhere else. so it will come up on the screen for the moment i haven't managed to put it into a vector or whatever in java to play with it. but i guess it's not very difficult. yeah, in java, yeah. yeah. yeah yeah, i'm sure they do. yeah. yeah. oh yeah, i will. i'm sure it's nothing difficult. i'm sure i'm making a meal of it at the moment actually. yeah, yeah. absolutely, yeah. should share as much as possible. yeah yep. next week sometime, yeah. i actually haven't done anything this week 'cause this week's been manic. but well, whatever it was, last week then. the the the week as it as is rather than the proper week, do you know what i mean. do you know that, it's been all a bit manic, the last m the last yeah. yeah, that's right, yeah. and then we had to do an i_r_p_, whatever it was last week as well. which is only a page long, but it's quite difficult to write a page. more diffi it was, it wasn't marked, but it was i had to sit there and think about it for a bit, which is a bit irritating. yeah, but s_p_n_l_p_. yeah. yep. so when it when it that's pretty bizarre, isn't it? well i guess that's how it works. they've got d that is pretty bizarre. yeah, yeah. that is pretty bizarre. wh four, and it w it li it just has an open variable transparent s list, whatever, find everything that's got that and then load yeah. yeah, yeah, 'cause that's the uh the declares a variable, doesn't it, and then they keep okay. right. oh see, obvious so did you have to write it in the way that they wrote it, is that what you did? right. okeydoke. fish the data, i was just thinking that, yeah. mm. have you annotated your code nicely? not yet. just in case. mission critical. yeah. commen commenting it out one bit at a time and running it, does it work, yeah. okay, get rid of that, next. good fun, aye. so basically we go and go and do some work really, i think that's the um the um the answer to that, isn't it. the long and the short of it. yeah. proba i'm still at the bottom of the mountain. yeah. well, should you find you want to explore any other perhaps you as your um uh quantify raising. you saw it, yeah. so what courses should i pick to be not doing any work at the moment? yeah. oh, so it's uh, yeah. yeah, me too. um. so so what's that, two weeks basically. ish yeah. yeah. okay. yeah, that's it's quite impressive actually. yeah. that's quite slow really. yeah. no, it's not, is it? yeah. can take us for a tutorial sometime. next week sometime. mm monday afternoon. uh three is alright. it was what time's d_n_l_g_? four, isn't it? three's good though. i'll but we have s whatever. what's you what would you prefer? we could three thirty in the in the computer room in here, and then we can just go stra if you can't can you get in the front door? oh, you haven't got a key, do you? can none of you get in there? the k the f there's computer rooms in here, the m_s_c_ computer lab and uh is in here. well if you find me, i'll show you where i'll i'll let us all in there, and we can all go in there. yeah, yeah. you do need to have a key for it. like that's the thing. it's got a lock door button. yeah, somebody will answer it. yeah, it's only got it's crap, it's only got about four or five computers in but it would do quite good for our job, 'cause it has not very uh p not many people in it very often. yeah, there's fridge there. and there's a photo-copier with the code on it, yeah yeah. it's cool, yeah. oh right. yeah, yeah. hopefully it's not that man, so it won't matter. some classes did and some classes didn't. it's all a bit bizarre really. they didn't really know what was going on. nah, make 'em work. done. oh, we trust you. yeah, i think the comments are basically the same as what you said. so it's yeah. oof. bu buzzes. yeah. signing off, innit? log off.
