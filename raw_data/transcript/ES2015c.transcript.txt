is everyone ready to start? okay. great. well, welcome to the third meeting of conceptual design. i'll just get the powerpoint presentation up and running. okay. um, on the agenda for this, um, for this particular meeting, we'll have your three presentations on what you've done since our last meeting, after we came up with um some general ideas of our design. and, um, then we have to make some key decisions on, on our remote control concept, and how we're gonna make it, what uh materials we're gonna use, and that sort of thing. the meeting will be forty minutes long. and um we will once again have poppy as our first presenter. alright, and i will switch up powerpoint. okay. um are they all included, like mandatorily, or r are these different options? yeah. mm. um what is a hand-powered dynamo? just every, every once in a while? just every once in a while or constantly? alright. it'd be kind of strange to always be cranking it i think. no. right. right. mm-hmm. yeah. mm-hmm. um one thing with the scroll buttons though. it, it we would have to have an l_c_d_ um display, and the glow in the dark thing might be difficult. yeah. right. yeah. uh. yeah. um, one concern with the rubber casing is that it would be rubber encapsulating all of these chips and diodes and delicate technology as like as the exterior. this is the one thing that's protecting its innards. yeah. another thing is it might be more difficult if it's a rubber exterior talking about putting on interchangeable plates. um, is it i don't see how a like a rubber plate going on top it would stay there. like if it was sort of like a clip-on plastic plate. it would work that way. yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah. alright. so maybe the yeah. yeah. yeah. that sounds good. i, um, is it possible to put designs onto this type of rubber? okay, we'll just say yeah. yes, just why not. alright. i like the kinetic energy source idea. um, i don't know when people will, um, be moving a remote around a lot. but i think that it's worth it, kinetety, kinetic um energy source. it could make an we could have any kind of style. it wouldn't be as heavy or bulky, and yeah. just for environmental reasons. yeah. yeah. yeah, you can watch a t_v_ in the dark then. yeah. i think that might be a little impractical though. yeah. like people don't wanna have to worry about that. yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah. or just like pick it up when you're gonna use it. yeah. alright. cool. 's that the end of your presentation. alright. thank you. yeah. that's um oh. okay. yeah. hmm. yeah. yeah, 'cause i'm sorry? um, because command interface requires you to type textual commands and input at a keyboard, so the numbers are sort of like a keyboard. you're pressing the numbers for, um, for what you want. yeah, we'll be doing yeah. it'd be more a command interface, and then yeah. hmm? yeah. i think they're talking about l_c_d_ type things. yeah. yeah. what do you mean? oh yeah, like how the buttons yeah, as a button though. so, it's a keyboard in the shape of it, right? okay. yeah. i like that idea. yeah. i'm sure i like kinetic energy would probably dip into the budget. a bit more too, yeah. mm-hmm. do you think that we should keep all the buttons to one same colour, just to keep it, give it a simplistic look. yeah. yeah. but what about the lighting up effect? um, well, um, i thought we had um decided that we would if you touched one of the buttons they'd all light up. and so if they were black, it wouldn't be possible for them to light up. if they were white they would glow, probably. if they were made out of rubber. oh. where would the light come from? yeah. yeah, and well rubber is a more translucent product too, so we have that taken care of. oh. mm. well, if they're raised up buttons. so that you can feel them. we were talking about it being more um, a lot more tangible. um, it might be more difficult to do. if they're, if they're sticking up. if it's flat then, like o like on a cellphone or a mobile phone, it's like all very flat, and you just have to sort of press down on these tiny little buttons, but yeah. yeah. okay. alright. if it's do-able we can do. yeah, sounds good to me. alright, thank you. that means you're up. yeah. mm-hmm. yeah. yeah, it's the fruits and vegetables is the only area that i find rather jarring. everything else we can really, we can really um, do, according to our plans already, given the market. but fruits and vegetables seems a very strange idea for a remote control. yeah. yeah. but they still need to um fit into people's decor though. yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah. tone it down. yeah, like more like photos of fruit, on, on our product. mm-hmm. yeah um alright, given that information, we need to start making some more specific decisions. so i'll need to um hook up the powerpoint again. but it's still around right? okay. okay. i'm just trying to make this pop up now. alright. here we go. okay so we have to uh decide now exactly what we are going to do. so energy, we oh. oh no i can't write it in when it's in this setting. does anyone know how to take it out of um, yeah. yeah. okay. um, so back to decisions. energy, we've decided on kinetic, right? okay, so that's good. hmm. but would a backup really be necessary? i mean will people just use the battery if there's no, if there's, if there is backup. yeah. yeah. there's like no reason why it wouldn't work, right? yeah. it could even be one of our selling points. yeah. yeah. environmentally conscious or something. yeah. alright, the next um decision is chip on print. i don't exactly know what that means. right, and we were going for more simplistic style, right? yeah. i think we decided on the pushbuttons, right? yeah. would we need a more advanced one for uh the lighting, the interior lighting system? yeah? okay. that's called medium, or regular? 'kay. okay, and cases. um, does this, is this dependent on shape, or what it's made of, or what? yeah. well, i guess plastic and coated in rubber. plastic with rubber coating and interchangeable um yeah, interchangeable plates. okay. user interface concept. this is your time to shine. oh, yeah. yeah. command interface. did you say command line? okay. line interface. alright, and supplements. what's that all about? um mm-hmm. um, what are our choices here? you mean like we'll have the numbers of the channels, and we'll have the channel-changer, and volume, and power? um yeah. like i don't know if we should go into like adjusting light levels, things like that, because different televisions will have um, yeah. yep. yeah, it was hardly ever used really. yeah. and most televisions will come with a remote. yeah. 'kay, well we know we want numbers. yeah, it does. yeah, and different televisions. like we, i don't know if we can make a remote that would be universal to all the different kinds of changes like that. volume. yeah. oh. we have five minutes to finish our meeting. crap. okay, um, let's do this fast. um should we have audio? it only comes up on mine usually. yeah, i don't, i it's, it's a problem with the international uh appeal, i think. um, if we have audio because we don't know how other televisions work. but we know that everyone has this and it's the same. yeah. yeah. alright. good. and, okay, in closing, 'cause we only have five minutes. we'll be meeting again in thirty minutes. um, you'll be working, poppy will be working on the look-and-feel design. wait a minute. is that right? yep, and um the user interface design, so this is where the trendy stuff comes in. and you'll be evaluating the product. um, poppy and tara will have to work together, using modelling clay. and, um, your personal coach will give you the rest of the information of what needs to happen. alright. so, anyone else have something to say? yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah. five.. mm-hmm. yeah. yeah. yeah. lots of yeah. alright. 'kay we'll stick to the fruit and veggie theme then. alright. and, um, we'll reconvene in thirty minutes. 'kay. bye. i'll see you later. oh, what did i just do. okay.
yeah. okay. okay. thank you. should be just loading. okay. oh, although i can't see it on my screen. that says go here. okay. i've been doing some research into the different components that we could use, um what's available to us f to actually make the remote control. um, first of all we have to look at how the remote control is actually made, and what is it happens inside the casing, which is more your field. um, thes main internal feature is a circuit board, which contains all the elec electronics and also the contacts with the power source. which is not necessarily a battery, as we're about to see. um, there are several components of, um, the circuit board that we need to consider, where we'll be getting them from, what they'll be made of. um, including the integrated circuit, which is also known as the chip. which is where all the main information is uh contained. um, diodes, transistors, resonators, resistors, and capacit capacitors all need to be considered as well. um, and all their positioning in the circuit. uh, these, they're all different options, they're all separate, apart from the chip, which we will probable decide whether we buy a simple, a regular, advanced. we can go into that later. um, all the other things are individual components that we'd have to get in separately, and work out the most, like, effective um circuit, including all the wires and everything like that. and the l_e_d_ of course, that's a light emitting diode. so, we could, so we've got flex flexibility with colours and things, with that as well. okay, there are lots of different possibilities for the energy source. we could use a basic battery, but that brings with it, like they need to be recharged and the bulk, the size of it as well. and they're not so great to dispose of, environmentally. there's a hand-powered dynamo which is a sort of thing that was used for torches fifty years ago. a bit out of date. kinetic energy is something that's been recently developed. um, where you manually charge up the power. like you wind up something. sorry? yeah. every once in a while i think. but it's yeah. it would be like going a step back in time. i don't think it would really be with kind of cutting edge technology. whereas kinetic energy is a new idea that's being used by some watches and other devices, where you just shake the device and it gives it power. i mean, the kinetic energy is transformed into power to make the circuit work. um, or there's solar power, which we've been considering inside a building, which is where it's gonna be used, might not be quite so useful. but, good to look into, renewable energy, always the way. um, lots of considerations for the case, like what sort of shape it would be, curved or flat. that's got a lot to do with the ergonomics. like how it's comfortable and s sits in the hand. we don't want something that's huge and you can't pick up. or too small. or too slidy. i know i've had a remote control before which you couldn't tell which was the front and the back, 'cause it had so many buttons on, and the shape was so symmetrical that i'd be pressing like a volume button instead of the on button. because you can't really see which way round it is. um, we also can choose what materials um, the we could use metal, we could use rubber which might be more um ideal for the anti-r_s_i_. it's like the same sort of rubber that's used in stress balls and things like that, so it's very like soft, not so stressful on your hands. wood. um, again, stepping back in time again there. i don't think that's quite up to date with what we're looking for here. um, titanium is not gonna be possible, even though it just it beyond our budget really. but, would've been maybe for future projects. um right our choice for buttons as well. we've developed some we've got some good advances in technology, with our research team have found some uh new multiple um option scroll buttons. i think that was brought up for, um, they're basically quite a flexible design, modern, you don't have to use individual buttons. you can just slide up and down. i'm sure we're all quite familiar with those on mobiles or computer laptop pads. yeah. that's true. and that would lead to an advanced yeah. if we have yeah. we're going on to that later with the advanc with the l_c_d_ that means we'd need a really advanced chip. and it's unlikely that that's gonna be in our budget. um, also we've got the integrated pushbutton, which is what we're most familiar with. it's the most straightforward. but you can in like incorporate that with a scroll button as well.. got decisions to make there. and this is what i was just saying before. linked in the different depends on what type of buttons we have and the inputs. um simple would go with the pushbutton. um, regular you could link with the scroll button. and the advanced we'd have to go with a l_c_d_ s display. my personal preferences? i think we could go for the kinetic energy source. i don't, i think that's quite um an advanced kind of technology. it's not been seen before, so it could be quite a, a novelty factor, attractive as well. and also energy saving 'cause you're producing the energy, you don't need an external sort of battery supply or solar panels. you just give it a shake. sounds brilliant to me. rubber casing i thing would probably the best, if we're going for the anti-r_s_i_ and like more choice with um aesthetics. like it could be pretty much any colour we want. um, and gives you, yeah, more flexibility there. and probably the regular chip as opposed to the simple, then we could possibly have the scroll and the push, but no l_c_d_, 'cause we probably can't afford that one. mm-hmm. i think that would, uh there would be an in sort of more internal casing. and the rubber would just be the, what's in contact with the human. yeah. yeah. maybe if the, um, if it was just kind of a, more of a rubber coating which was on to a case. so, it was kind of, the whole thing would be removable. yeah. like i can't think of what. yeah. or like an you can get sort of outer casing for ipods and something, that's just it's protective as well. it, it stops it, i mean, it would reduce the impact if it was dropped or something, as well, 'cause it wouldn't damage itself so easily. i think i maybe a mixture of both there, maybe. yeah. and then yeah. yeah. yeah. as far as i know. it should be. yeah. yeah, yeah. yeah. i thought that was yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah. like as a backup for something. yeah. yeah. some alternative just in case something went wrong. that's true. i just thought of that. yeah. yeah. may maybe that could be the backup. instead of a battery. like solar backup. yeah. i suppose s but some but thing is, it's not you don't need the solar all the time. it can be stored. it can be like you can have the solar energy and then it can store that energy and use it. it just needs to be in light for a certain amount of time per day. like a few hours a day.. that's true. it could easily yeah. i suppose it would be really annoying if you get to think, oh no, i forgot to charge my remote today. like if the kinetic thing, i think what's best about that is that it's instant energy. you don't have to, you know, you can shake it a few times, or whatever. and it works. yeah. instead of you don't have to like make sure it's in the right place to charge and. k okay. yeah. there we go. it wasn't on mine either. i don't know why. i think, i just, i just used the mouse on there. yeah. mm. yeah. so i suppose sometime after you. mm. i s i suppose where um mm on some buttons you would have like the power would be s some kind of symbol. and if you wanted to go onto teletext or, i know we're not having that, but i mean a similar thing, you, they have there's a like little picture with a screen with lines across it, which i suppose it's that sort of thing like the, the symbol on the button. but if we're having a simplified display anyway, w that, we probably won't have to focus so much on that. it'll be more the on the numbers and the volume. i suppose we need to think of symbols for like the volume, display, and stuff like that. i for inp mm. yeah. yeah. that's true. that's in like the buttons with all the different like colours for different choices and things. it can be a bit, yeah, overwhelming. yep. oh. i'd assume, like, an internal light, that comes through. so there would have to, have to be some parts maybe transparent around the buttons, or something. yeah, yeah. it should be able to mm-hmm. li yeah. mm-hmm. i think it would be possible. i don't think it would make that much difference. i mean, the uh the dimensions of it. 'cause if it's just like constructed in the same way as like the front cover of a mobile phone. you can like take off the hard cover and then there's the like say the buttons. and then you get to the circuit. i don't think it would matter that the buttons were bigger through the, the top casing. i'm sure you could f work it out to fit in the casing, without causing too much difficulty. i'm sure that'd be fine. okay. you're not plugged in yet. mm. it is strange. well we i think we possibly could take a more abstract design. like look at the basic shapes of different fruits and vegetables. and then just really like strip it down to like really basic shapes. i mean we don't have to make something in the shape of a strawberry, but it could have the curves of a strawberry, or something. or a strawberry seed or a leaf. or just like you know really make it a quite abstract, if that's fits in more with what we're doing. instead of fruits and vegetables, just if you look at it straightforward, it's a bit yeah. it doesn't s quite fit in with the trendy well, obviously it does, if that's the current theme. but may maybe we could go more directly, i don't know. but initially, i dunno. i think if we just sort of tone it down a bit. yeah and like not, not yeah. mm. yeah. i didn't for the first one. but i have now. yeah. uh, hopefully. project documents i think. okay. 'kay. kinetic yeah. are we going to have a backup? or do we just i think maybe we could just go for the kinetic energy, and be bold and innovative, and hope this works, and well hope that it works. i think yeah. i think no. i, i think we should just like take uh advantage of like using this to its full potential. go for it. it could be fully kinetic energy. yeah. is everyone happy with that? yeah. um, it was whether we went for the simple, the regular, or the advanced chip. and that linked in with what buttons we would gonna have, so yeah, it was so that was without the l_c_d_. so that means we're not doing the advanced. so it depends on whether we wanted the scroll buttons or just the push buttons. uh, so that's the simple. yeah possibly. so, it's probably gonna be the regular chip that we're going to need. so it's a medium. so regular chip. regular sorry. regular chip. lighting. yeah if we because of the lighting that we've decided to put in as well. so th i think this is just like gonna be the a very outer case, which we will decide on rubber. rubber. yeah. plastic rubber coat. interchangeable, yeah. still going for that. yeah. your screen? was it ouch. the power. volume. may yeah. tone, contrast, and things. that's a bit yeah, it was minima well, it wasn't the l yeah. that would be good. yeah, and surely that would be like quite specific to the individual television, so mm. i think most of that comes like on the i individual television set itself, doesn't it? i'm sure it has its own buttons, so you don't necessarily need to have it on remote. yeah. so we're just going for power, channels, volume, mm. i've yeah, that's it. we can just go for, make it a selling point that it is just the basic. yeah uh i brilliant. mm-hmm. okay. um, i just have one question about the whole fruit and vegetable aspect. are we seeing as that was the most popular thing that came up out of your market research, i thi i think we should keep to that rather than moving to animals or something, because even if that may not seem obvious to us, if that's what the surveys brought out, i think that we should probably go along with that. um, so i suppose that'll come out in our dev design development. but you're happy to go ahead with the fruit and veg? y yeah. we can have a look at those ideas, yeah. yeah. yeah. tricky. a lot of things to consider. hm. okay. okay. thank you.
yeah. yeah. yeah. w like plastic with rubber, kind of on top well, there's, there is a certain phone that has like a rubber casing, b like a nokia it is. it's yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah, tha backup. yeah. that would be good yeah. maybe we could you were saying about um solar power ma maybe not working indoors, but a lot of calculators, yeah, have solar power. so maybe that could be incorporated as yeah. do, do those calculators yeah. i don't know how it works. yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah, i suppose. yeah. yeah. thanks. oh. it's not on my screen. why? you don't know why? oh okay. is it that one? um, i'm just gonna go through the interface concept with yous now. uh, first of all i'll explain what a user interface is. it's the aspects of a computer system which can be seen or otherwise perceived, for example, heard or felt maybe, or by the human user. and it's also the commands that the user uses to control its operation and to input data. um, there are two types of user interfaces. there's the graphical user interface, which emphasises the use of pictures for output and a pointing device, for example a mouse for input control. so that's sort of like the scroll thing we were talking about. yeah. i'm not really sure about the pictures that maybe that's on an l_c_d_ screen. or maybe it's the the buttons or pictures or something. do you think it's yeah. yeah. so you must, for the graphical user you must need some kind of presentation for the graphics. like an l_c_d_ screen. yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah. no i think it's to do with the actual symbols that are on the, that's on the buttons of the remote control, and per well it could be a wee scroller thing, and something could come up on the screen. yeah. but um i think we're gonna go with the command interface anyway, to make it more simplistic. but the, we could incorporate some of the graphical user um points, as in just to make it m um nicer to look at maybe. like i can't think of an example, but sort of like little pictures rather than like a little sound. instead of saying volume, like a little speaker or something. yeah, something y yeah m perha yeah. yeah. maybe. um, the co uh we've decided that the command interface would be the most useful for a remote control. as it would be less complicated, and the controls would be more user-friendly. um, the remote control would be cheaper to design, so that we'd have more money in the budget to, um, target the design area of the interface. you know, make it more trendy and original. we'll have more money if we keep it simple. yeah. seeing as it's quite a new technology. um we, we also have to keep in mind when we're designing our, um, more user-friendly remote control, that a lot of interfaces consist of a clutter of buttons, that, um, that their functions, colours and forms aren't always helpful. yeah. yeah. and that all interfaces are different. so, um, that doesn't improve the use of the produ product, so we need to come up with something that's easy to understand. and maybe learn from the mistakes of other interfaces that can be too complicated for people to use. does anyone have any questions? mm. but um yeah. in the phone that i was thinking of as well, when you change the um covers of it, the, the little buttons that actually, you know, that contro control stuff, are behind the rubber. so you can change the buttons when you're changing the faces. do you know what i mean? 'cause it's just the wee control, yeah, thing that's behind it. so i mean, we don't have to decide on one colour. each face could have its own colour of buttons maybe? yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah. so that's everything, then? yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah, yeah. yeah. yeah. or banana-shaped. yeah. where do you have to save it to? okay. just escape i think. yeah. yeah. hope so. yeah. yeah. i don yeah. yeah. it's for the lighting, yeah. yeah. yeah plastic coat. we decided on the component. i, i i'm sorry, i've lost my um powerpoint thing, so i can't remember what it's ca it's the component the command inter the command line interface yeah. yeah. um, i think that is well we haven't really made any decisions about what we're gonna do about the cluster of button functions, colours and forms, in the in consistent use. like what what are ideas to combat these problems? you know how um different interfaces are very different, and can be confusing because because of their difference, and because of the different clusters of buttons that they have. we haven't really decided what to do about that. well it's just um w where where shall we locate the buttons. what kind of functions wi shall we have? so pretty just just the basic button functions. yeah. yeah, each television. you don't change that often, yeah. yeah. yeah. it w it would seem silly if we'd having anything else, just have an audio button though. do you know? but we yeah. that could be a sales pitch. simple and yeah. yeah. what i what i was thinking what do yous think of this? um, having the numbers kind of like, not a bunch of grapes, but you know like purple and kind of in a triangle. like grapes. like that's kind of fruity or something. that's just yeah. okay.
yes. mm. mm-hmm. mm-hmm. mm-hmm. like the skin? yeah. okay. so the actual remote would be hard plastic and the casings rubber. okay. and the buttons obviously are rubber. okay. mm-hmm. i guess it's a bit scary 'cause it hasn't been done before. so it seems we'd have to do more research on it. or i dunno if you could have a battery pack. yeah so there's there is a one battery, because most remotes use two batteries i believe. so, if it was running off of one battery as a right. although it needs some light, doesn't it? so, if we're doing yeah. if we're yeah. yeah. i think sometimes it's just shoved under, under a cushion, and yeah. yeah. so it's just draf graphical for the pointing aspect? the infrared is like, that's considered a okay. so when it says pointing device that doesn't include okay. okay. mm-hmm. mm. i think if we go with the um design plate thing, we'll have to. just because of colour clashing, and if we wanted to, so and, and we might, i mean, depending on what comes out of the design, we might have to stick to just black buttons. you mean different colours for the lighting or mm-hmm. oh i see what you're saying. well y oh so you're picturing the light is coming from the back. i kinda pictured it as kind of coming from the sides and lighting it up frontwards. but, but i guess, you mean from the back. okay. okay. right. mm-hmm. oh. yeah. they, they insert over. okay. t okay is that my turn then? alright. i have a shorter report for you today. um, it took a while to get this, uh uh. oh. that's a very good point. okay, so um, this report is about uh trend-watching. um, basically so we can live up to our, our uh purpose of having a very fashionable remote control. sorry. there we go. um so, just so you know, my method was mainly web web-based research this time around. i also spoke with fashion experts in milan, new york and paris. and i looked at the design reports from previous years, here at real remote. um, just so c we can work off of them, see how fashions have changed. um, so i'll list the three most important aspects that i've come across. um, and they, they're each more important than the one that comes after it. uh, the first one is that there should be a fancy look-and-feel, instead of the current functional look-and-feel. um, this should be our priority, as we've been saying. the second most important aspect is that a remote sh that the remote control should be technologically innovative. so, i think we've done a lot of talking about that, just with lighting and the buttons and the face-plates. um, so it looks like we'll be able to keep on track with that. and the third most important aspect is that the remote control should be easy to use. so, pretty basic there. and the recent fashion update, uh, according to fashion-watchers in paris and milan, is that fruit and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes, shoes and furniture. um, also, in contra uh in contrast to last year, the feel of the material is expected to be spongy. again, we've already discussed that with rubber versus hard plastic buttons. um so, my personal preferences here, um of course, as we, we've already talked about the personal face-plates in this meeting, and i'd like to stick to that. the fruits and vegetable themes, i don't know if that's going to work for us. it sounds something that you'd use on kitchenware. i don't know if we wanna do it on remotes. it could be one of the options. maybe for the television that people have in their kitchen. um, the temporary light-up idea, sounds like we're gonna stick to that. and then, uh, tying in a trendy look with user-friendliness. mm-hmm. it's, it's a little but it, it's everywhere. so maybe we i've seen a lot of purses with olives on them, you know. but i i think, i think if we stick to t_v_ based, you know, maybe t_v_ shows, or or colour schemes. right. yeah. the the essence of strawberry. yeah. i guess, yeah. one thing i was thinking though is i dunno if you all remember from our kickoff meeting, we talked about our favourite animals. so maybe there could be animal-based, you know. because a lot of people have a house cat. or, or a dog. um, that might be getting, you know, too specific, and we should see what the success of the first face-plates are. but it's something to keep in mind. and, did you have any questions? pretty straightforward? okay. there you go. have you guys been saving your powerpoint presentations to the okay. the powerpoint? so so if it's not working they just have to shake it a bit and that revitalises it? okay. mm-hmm. oh, is regular not simple? right right right. think it was called command interface. command interface,. mm-hmm. that was on, um one of my presentations. about how often it was used. do you remember that? i w should i bring it up? the ch t screen settings was used um zero point five times an hour. so tw twice every once every two hours. um, and it was considered a one point five relevance, on a scale of ten. that's brightness, colour, tone, all that. mm-hmm. the other one was audio settings. mono, stereo, pitch. i mean i sometimes use that. some t_v_s will have the option of like living room style, movie style, um and that, they say that's used zero point eight times an hour, which is actually somewhat high. like almost once an hour. um, relevance of two. well that didn't some up on mine. oh. yeah i guess that it affects the marketing, 'cause it, mm it is a good sales ploy to say, aren't you annoyed with remote controls that have all these buttons. this one has channel, volume and your channe and your power. yeah. okay. mm-hmm. yeah. now do you guys need want an idea of how many uh are you gonna come up with casing ideas? like f five different mm-hmm. yeah you can have some fun with the buttons, it's true. yeah. i guess what you i ideally you'd kind of think of age markets as well. so it's a something that will, you know, appeal to the fifteen to twenty five year olds. something that your granny would want on her remote control. um, and international tastes as well, so not easy. okay.
