now what. okay, so my name is petre. you can call me petre, or peter if you like. i don't care. uh, in the project i'm supposed to be the technic. bob, okay. okay. okay. okay. so probably i would try to try to draw the animal. well sh should i draw the picture of the animal? i i th i think i should. okay, so. um. okay, american, um. um. i would use the bird. so i tried to sketch it out. i had to first uh write it down because i am not absolutely sure if i can draw it, but ah. can you recognise it as a bird? okay it's your turn to oh it's okay. yeah. i should get used to the tool, so. oh just wait a little bit. c could we put it here, to make it as straight as possible? ah probably not. okay, it it works like this. are you left-handed? oh, pity. ah, it's maybe better if you leave it. you won't draw them, or? just try. i would like to see how it looks like. no, i think it's clear. it's okay. it's in it's indeed beautiful. okay. bob. have to remember it. bob. per unit, i guess. y oh okay. okay. oh. okay, i have also some points uh. maybe two points. uh first would be that in current remote controls there is no back light, so if you are if you are uh playing with this in the dark room it's it's probably worth to to have something like uh back light. and maybe it could be also dependant on the the amount of of light in the room, so that if if it's in the day it doesn't need to be back lighted because it works on the battery, so. so something like this. and the second thing, f second point from me would be that in a normal remote control there is uh there are two buttons for volume control. but i prefer like a potential-meter or something like. you know, some slider or not just two discrete buttons for volume, but something which yeah, but i can reach in uh one second i can mute it down, or or make a high volume. ah, n. if it drops to the floor then it starts to scream. yeah, f it depends what what you feel about that. yeah but we can we can think of these things afterwards, but if you have some more notes on that. okay. um. okay, just a second. which i which is hamed,? okay. uh i am the technical designer, i dunno which one, uh v. user interf okay. okay, so i'm the first one. i see. sign. okay. uh.
my name is hamed getabdar, and uh i'm going to be interface designer in this project. i dunno if i should go with this. if it is enough line. i'm sorry. okay. they should be remote. okay, thanks. no. okay. should i clean? okay, i think like horses uh because they are strong and beautiful, so if i want to write it here, i think i can. oh. okay. i dunno if i can. okay. it may be like a cow or i dunno, whatever. i'm not good very good in drawing. okay, so this is very it's a bird, i think. i dunno what is it. four. okay. mm-hmm. mm. yeah. i'm shameful yeah. okay. mm-hmm. uh i yeah, just a simple experience. i uh i prefer um remote control working with radio waves, because remote control working with infra-red rays you should you should you should keep it in a specific direction and then try it hard to tune. mm. yeah. uh-huh. mm-hmm. mm-hmm. okay. okay, thanks. bye.
uh my name's bob mor. oh, sorry. 'kay. so my name's bob morris. i'm the marketing expert for this project. bob yeah. yeah go ahead. okay, okay. so i think my favourite animal would be a c a cat. that's its head. um i probably like cats the most because they're cuddly and furry and uh playful. okay. thanks. maybe put it up put it a maybe put it on the desk or something. uh, that's better. your lapel microphone's fallen off. yeah. yeah. maybe we should just continue. yeah, don't worry about it. no. oh that's good, it's good. yeah, and strong. well, from experience, um i've had remote controls in the past that have had very they've had lots and lots of buttons and they've been very small, and it's been very hard to to to use, because there's so many buttons, and you know it's very hard to see which buttons do what, and the buttons are very small and very hard to press. um and and normally you only every use, you know, on a t_v_ remote you only ever use, mostly, you know, f four or f six buttons. um. so it's frustrated me in the past, th that. ah, okay. okay. okay, n is that because the of the discrete volume levels, or is that yeah. yeah. okay. he's the industrial designer? no, you're the industrial designer. yeah, i think that's the first. i_d_. industrial designer. and the second one is the user interface designer. and then last one's marketing, which is me. great, okay. thanks guys. bye.
