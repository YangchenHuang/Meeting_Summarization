hmm. that's uh strange. yeah. okay. let's try this. uh um. mm-hmm. mm. uh no, no. yeah. okay. uh blank. no. uh well i think the the the goal of a remote control is that it's it it has an influence on the t_v_ set. and that it controls the channels and the the volume. and uh i i i think it's positive if there's a a led uh uh a led on the corner of the of the remote. so that you know it s it still has batteries on it in it. and that if you push the button the led uh gives a light, and uh and you see that it's working. and uh yeah. uh yeah, but no no no. but i my my experience is that it it it's convenient to have that. yeah. yeah. hmm. yeah. yeah well that's that are good ideas. uh yeah well the led on the corner, that that indicates that it's working. if you push a button. um yeah. and looking on the budget, not too expensive uh material. so probably plastic or something. uh mm no. yes.
nice. an elephant. 'kay... pop-ups. what is this, pictionary. uh a bird. bird. yeah. whoo. oh not. oh. okay. okay. yeah. no problem. shit happens. a parrot. ish. he did it before. oh. thank you. uh i will start. uh big one, they are uh not easy to use. um i have one set and uh a remote control, when i dropped it, uh it broke. so that won't be uh our goal, i think. and uh g big buttons, m uh that's easier to use than uh i think. not all the small buttons, you don't know big buttons, positive. all all small buttons like when you have uh like a hundred buttons on your remote control, you won't know what they're working for. thank you. help also. thank you. the weight. not not too heavy. not much buttons. bust-free. that when you drop it, it won't break. like uh some kind of rubber on it. or hard uh hard plastic. uh buttons not too small. uh something like when you uh lose your uh remote control, sometimes it happen. uh it between the couch and you can't find it. when you push a but a button on the t_v_, then you hear some uh some sort of bleep. and then you uh, hey there there's remote control. next. i have one more idea. just popped up. uh it it won't take a lot of batteries. so you don't won't have to change the batteries uh once a week or uh once every two weeks. okay. thank you.
yep. okay. oh. well we will try. where it going? hmm. uh mm. so now save? now uh blank? yeah. yeah, yeah. i'm not getting anything uh on my screen now. okay. wow. oh. nice. uh at home we have a t_v_, a video uh recorder, a d_v_d_ player, and a satellite receiver. we have uh four distinctive remote controls for that. that's not really ea easy. so it would be nice if we have one for all. and we also had a remote control for our radio set. but um i it it had a lot of buttons on it, and you didn't know which one was what. and it was uh uh v not easy to use. so we n barely used it. yeah. yeah i think it uh from a marketing point of view, it also has to look nice. or you won't sell it. and um yeah uh on our website we can see what products we already have. and it should work with as many uh as possible of them. yes. okay.
