uh almost. ready. i'm uh michael. i'm the user interface designer. ah well if no one else wants to, yeah. okay so, want me to draw my favourite animal. let's see. well, i don't really have a favourite animal, but um uh i think i have one in mind, so uh i'm gonna about the uh spider because you can actually draw it pretty well in the corner of a white board. the spider has a spider lives in a web and uh it has eight legs, and uh it can move all about the web in two dimensions. unless it's a three dimensional web which y they have sometimes. there are some spiders that live in like that have like uh kind of a a big ball of a of a web. and uh the other thing is some spiders can actually uh fly like uh they have uh they let out like uh a stream of like the web building material but it's it acts like a parachute so they can actually kind of go and find new uh build a new web somewhere else. so i think they did this in uh in charlotte's web that movie that little uh well it's actually a book first but uh um at the end all the the spiders kinda flew away. so, that's my animal. maybe it's happy 'cause it just ate someone. so you don't like pink panthers? so is this uh an indian or an african elephant, 'cause you haven't drawn the ears? okay. we can discuss that off-line. so could i just ask one question, um is this a stand-alone unit that we're gonna be selling? so it's gonna be you already have a t_v_ but you're buying an extra remote control for it or something? okay, alright. okay well, so, it seems the the first thing that they've kinda specified is the price like based on how much profit we wanna make, which seems to a kind of a little strange if we don't know what the the product is yet, but i guess if that's if that's the requirement that we need to to design the the product to actually fit that that price bracket so, i guess we're gonna need to find out what's actually you know, what people ar are willing to pay for um what kind of product they're expecting for twenty-five euro because it seems quite a lot for a remote control, so it's yeah. okay. alright.
good morning. and i am hemant, the industrial designer. but don't you think it's very difficult to draw a panther? so bad i don't like it. um sure. oh yeah. thanks. this lapel is coming out once in a while. it's not very strong. okay. so, not the favourite animal, but i think i'll draw elephant. i'll try to draw elephant. it's a problem. okay, thanks. okay so, elephant goes like this, and then it has four feet. i don't know whether there's any dist there should be any distance or not, but i think this is the easiest. and then we have it's trunk. and yep something like this. an eye, cute. yeah, so and sometimes they have a hump. it seems that uh elephants are pretty friendly and they they have one very important way a different way of walking. so when they walk, wherever they are going to put their first feet, the second feet will always be. when they'll come to that position the second, the third feet will be there. that's the way they walk. and that's very peculiar about them. none of the other animals walk like this. and they are very useful to human beings. at least few few hundred years ago when there was no means of transportations or something, or when they had to carry huge um loads from one place to another, elephants were very useful. and they are found in um usually the warm countries. and um they are the biggest terrestrial animal. that's what i know about them. so, that's what i wanted to tell about elephants. there are two kind of uh yeah, they are very different, indian and african elephants. so indian elephant is having one bump, i think, and the african have two. and then there's a difference in the trunk of the animals, these elephants who are indian and so at some for some elephants it's the trunk is having one do we have some message there? wind up? okay, some other time. thank you. thanks. marketing person. mm-hmm. thanks.
hi i'm guillermo. i'm the marketing expert. 'kay i dunno why, but when i was a child i i wanted to be a a panther not a pink panther, or maybe yes. uh yeah yeah. okay it's a friendly panther. yeah maybe. um. actually, honestly i i i dunno what's what's his it's be behaviour, i dunno if if it's the male who who hunts or it's the female uh, i i i have watched that lions di didn't hunt it's the the female lions who who hunt, so but i like it because it's fast, and it's black as well, so it can he it can hide itself very easily and it's it's it looks like um powerful, strong, uh i dunno. i i watch a a film about a black panther when i was a child and i was in that age when everything was shocking me a lot. okay. i like it. yeah.
