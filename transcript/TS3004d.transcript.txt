oh. okay. so just f um so this is our agenda. you're f you're going to show your pr prototype presentation after me. uh i didn't oh yeah. so these are the so these are the um last notes we i made. if anything doesn't look right, just say it to me then. i don't have to put it in the report. okay, but it's still possible uh uh financially. so if you want to, it's okay. okay, just slide open is uh quite usable for remote controls. maybe that's better. yeah, that's that's a very good point. yeah. okay. so this is okay? okay, so that's uh i'll just have a look how much that is. but um okay, for the okay. no, you have a different chip for speech recognition. so so i already calculated that and it's still in the budget. so it's okay. so you can show your prototype if you want to. okay, cool. okay. mm. so how many functions do you need for for uh the microphone? yeah, speech recognition. just only one button to say it's on or off. so you can put it on the back as well if you want to. okay. yeah, you can put it separate. okay. and do you still can, do you still can choose what colour, kind of colour you want? how do you want to implement that? just on the maybe on the second level as well? okay, just draw draw the second level, because we need that as well. yeah, as well. just make make a just just draw a second level one and say all options that are still left or something. yeah. no no, just on down there. so uh just uh if you s yeah, y maybe, yeah. for the bottom. no, you gotta slide it. yeah, it's right. yeah. you want to save that file as well? the drawing? doesn't really matter. just just uh yeah. yeah. yeah. or we just make it three buttons, all the colours on it. just red, yel uh red, green and that's that's very easy, yeah. yeah. okay. yeah. no, ma on on o on the on the yeah. just make it yeah, just put it on those extra f extra function as well. oh just three stages, you yeah, that's okay. yes, that's to remember. yeah, but that's that's uh that's a functionality for the television. okay. yeah, but you have to search every time again. that's what what happening if you do it like that. but it's still the television that has to do that. no, that's what the television does. okay, it's cool. yeah, that's fine. is this prich pretty much it, yeah? it's too expensive to make it from a different material anyway. yeah? okay, cool. mm mm mm mm mm. yeah, i don't know what this means. but i think we just evela evaluated this one. oh okay, you made some criteria. okay, cool. okay. you have some usability criteria or okay. look-and-feel? okay. okay. uh i think uh if you have a kind of ipod idea. it quite beautiful. it's we are actu we are the flashy. but uh it's black. yeah, yellow light. do we have yellow light? no, not really, but it's possible. it's yeah, different colours. this is oh, the same as th th the cover. but also th the light behind it. no, no. make them no, just make them black or grey or something. yeah. yeah, just give it a one. it's okay. it's perfect. i think it's just what you want. or not? okay, just give it a two. yeah. no. no, it's only on the number, behind the numbers and uh that as well, yeah. yeah, but that's unnecessary. yeah. it doesn't make no. yeah. but yeah. mayb okay. yeah, just only yeah, that's right. so yeah, that's how i think. ye yeah, this it is a one. it's okay. it's cool. this is a difficult one, because we we don't yeah, we don't know it about the uh it's it's very easy to use, but uh the second layer is not easy to use. it's that's no. but the rest of it is very easy, because there are so so n so it is learnable um f i i in the first place it's very easy to use. and i think its scrollwheel is u easy to use as well, if you have ever used uh a different kind of uh of uh device. but yeah. okay, just easy to use is very cool, so just give it a two. no, but definitely better, much better than uh than uh than avera average, yeah. okay. slide is not n is is not new. no. i already have a uh i already have a v_c_r_ and it's about from nineteen eighty eight. and they all have a slide in it. so that's not new. yeah. that's cool. yeah for a uh for a f there are no games on it, that's that's it's not a one, it's a two again. but if you have yeah. oh yeah, that's right. rechargeable. yeah, just draw it afterwards. if you can you save it on the same, in the same map as the other ones? in the the project uh map? yeah. mm-hmm. uh save as? no, that's not in the project. oh yeah, okay. smart board. yeah, but this one. this one is not yet in the oh oh. but you still have to draw the resi the recharger. okay. and new features, so we give it a two or also again a one? no, i think i if you have games on it, then then you give you have a one. but not no, just so it's still a two. targeted audience. uh we are the targeted audience? do we like it? yeah, but l younger than forty. so we we are exactly the targeted group. i think so, yeah. you get the fancy things for younger people. and you get the the aesthetic things for older people. so you want yeah, you get different colours. so oh. so that's eleven. it's yeah, it is one point eight three. oh yeah, that's still yeah, maybe we have to skip that one. okay. so i just got a financial um you s saved it or no. okay, let's have a look at this one here, the production cost of it. if i forgot anything, just say it to me. it just is a battery. yeah, there are some that they didn't mention, because recharge is not on the list. but okay. so i think we are pretty much in the right direction, because it's twelve point three euros. so this is a regular chip incl and and a sample speaker. so that's both. yeah, and single curved curved. no, that's not on the list. but that shouldn't be. probably. i just the b the button supplements, i didn't i d i was wondering if this special colour maybe was i'm not sure. see it's i think it's okay like this. it's hard to say. but maybe we have to um yeah, okay. special colour, you can skip this one, because it's all quite normal. we get different ones, that's all. so you can put a recharger in it as well. but this is expensive, the sample speaker. yeah. yeah, that's included. yeah, no. okay, so this is uh pretty much it this. so i just want you yeah, we just made it. so we can do the project evalu evaluation now for uh for everything together. okay. we can do some discussion about this. was there room for creativity? paul, was there room for crea creativity? yeah. yeah. okay, so the leadership was there a leadership and okay. what do you have to say about that? i dunno. yeah, i know. okay, next one. uh team work um the the third meeting i think that one was pretty hard. we were not all we were not um agree with every not agree with. we're not finished. yeah. yeah, finance. but the teamwork was okay. yeah. 'kay. yeah, what i have to say about uh means. the smart board is okay. digital pen is horrible. i dunno if you use it. but if you want to download it to your computer, it's doesn't work. no. yeah. it's the same for the presenta for the presentations. you can do it from here. that's much easier than standing there. and so you've yeah. yeah, like. okay. i think yeah, okay. so we made it in time. and we made a remote control. in the budget, yeah. i don't know what it mean. just for remote control probably. no, for the project. yeah. but it's for the next team. we don't have to do that. yes, i think just i just write a final report. no, we have only four minutes left. uh it's okay. okay. you have to save everything, you know that, huh? okay, yeah.
it's not saved yet. so our beautiful drawing. are we doing the the speech recognition? because we didn't have enough time to uh de um design the inside as well. okay yeah. well then then we're gonna put it in. yeah, just uh we have to design the inside then, but it should be uh it's may maybe uh a bit stronger as well. okay, so when you have a lot of room inside. so you can make it very easy to use. 'cause you can write a lot of comments besides it. no. yeah, we're gonna use the advanced chip then. advanced chip was for uh spee yeah. okay. good. together? i'll give comments. speech recognition. um i didn't have a specification of that. but um i can imagine that you have to input your voice or something. um so i've yes, you need options to configure it, and after that you don't need 'em anymore. yeah, you can put 'em all on the back. that's for sure. that's uh we also don't know how many buttons are required, or what kind of buttons. but you have a lot of room if you can slide it open. you yeah i know. i can imagine you need at least four buttons or something. so but it's enough room. uh well well the main, the main zap buttons are most central. that was the the most important thing. so uh the best place, the best reach place um on-off buttons, text buttons, mute buttons are together and at a place they easily are, easy to find. um the on-off button is a bit bigger, uh so it stands out. that way you don't have to make it red, 'cause it's will uh will show up. uh scrollwheel is on the left side. it's basically the be standard place for scrollwheel, as far as i know. yeah. okay yeah, they yeah okay. that's that's below that then. it's uh twelve buttons. yeah okay, just we just missed that. but um i'll just uh i'll get back to later. f the form well, we've taken that from the ipod, other popular technical device. so um should be popular. um the f uh the buttons creating? uh if you that or all round shapes, not uh rounded corners. so that, you know, you get a bit round feeling. um we'll use hard plastic. since that allows us to use uh two d_ buttons, uh non-rubber buttons. colour changeable. well and um the backlight thing, the thing that lights up. we have decided uh in the the channel buttons, there's a little uh colour around it. and also in the num-pads, there's also colour light behind it. so when you pre yeah. we're going to implement. yeah. mm just a little yeah. yeah, i um to your video device. yeah. is i ah okay. um slides i think. it's you can do it that it claps open, but i think that's not solid enough. if that breaks then you're screwed. so it do doesn't even have to slide all the way open. um uh i the the speech functions buttons. menu button. with uh maybe uh arrows. so you can uh scroll in the, navigate the menu. um i think we can even put a we have one for the zero and one for the for the more digit uh channels. so you have one left for the right, the video channel, play station, etcetera. that's used pretty often. if you have a play station, mm you use it every day. that was it. uh it doesn't really matter. that's yeah well we don't have any uh hmm? what else? uh menu buttons with arrows. s just uh like um i think it's best if we do. mm where do we have or there. like on the normal uh like this. the menu button, yes. well we don't have any, anything on how many buttons speech requires. so you can't redesign it. yep. just press it once, the colour should uh switch. press again, the colour switch again maybe? yep. yeah, maybe some uh some text next to the scroll wheel, that it is volume. i just uh the volume logo. yeah. yeah, we have that on the the text button. uh why not? no whoa i think um yeah, the three stages. yes. no, it doesn't have to turn it off. just don't yeah. i dunno if yeah, i think as well, but uh yeah. yeah, in thi the the remote control in the the chip. yeah, that's true. so yeah. um do we need to fix that or just like your telephone, hard plastic. i think just on the buttons. if you do it abo above or below, it takes uh more space. i don't think the space is worth it. mm. okay. well i think we do if it's really uh, if you can if you can get the ipod look, then it's beautiful, i think. hmm? um basic colours, um yeah. well you didn't say. maybe um company colours? black. a bit a bit of yellow. not not not yellow, but just a bit of light yellow. like white, also ni or uh always nice. just um yes. yeah, grey. just dark grey i think. well we have changeable fronts, so so yeah. it's hard to decide for us, but yeah. it it's at least it's a lot better than uh current remote controls. yeah. mm. not needed. yeah, not needed i think. yeah. what do i think is necessary necessary item? of course it's reachable. okay, maybe just some light uh to to light it all up. so you can see what's really there. not just not re on the buttons or something. just a green light or some blue light. to light it all up. yeah. well yeah. uh semi-transparent. yeah, w we've done a a lot of detail in light, so yeah. yeah. so i think it's easy to use, but and learnable is a bit well y just uh f yeah, i think it's very clear what it all does. yes. but the second parts, uh like speech, etcetera, that will be harder to learn. it's yeah it's device. okay. maybe three then. learnable's yeah okay. yeah. yep, true. then a two. and the scrollwheel, backlights, slide. but also slide that buttons come out, as well? okay. yes. different colours, so yeah. that would and we didn't uh but then we also have the the home station. we are forgetting about that now, but we don't recharge. but that's more like uh now. i don't know. uh just save, save as? okay. yeah, it is. uh untitled? yeah, it doesn't matter. save. n mm. i think we followed the latest trends. oh right. well uh fruit and vegetables, yeah. you can different front uh this is a a power indicator. so you can see how far it's charged up. to call. um okay. no no, i want that in. yeah, th the speaker is very small as well, right? yes uh. yeah, we can uh um different fronts, but standard front won't be, yeah. yeah. this? oh, them. is that uh included? in the twelve euro or okay, then we then we need to use it. yeah. damn, solar cells are uh expensive. okay. mm uh i yeah, i think so. i think uh everyone uh already. so i think we uh discussed a lot of things about it. so of course there was. yeah. one leader to check the time, etcetera. so more like a secretary. uh i think we we got wrong information at the wrong time. i think that was the m biggest problem. like uh the prices. if we knew that before, we could have uh had discussion really uh s really quicker. yeah, and if you had uh fifteen euros, then we would it. we had to yeah. i think uh everyone listen to each other. like marketing said things and then we had to i include them in the design. it was just doesn't work. well uh smart board would be very uh nice to work with, if it worked really well. just not work too slow. yeah, more accurate. yeah, it's i it should be more accurate. and uh i think it would be great if you could edit it from, just with a mouse, from where you're sitting. not just pointing out on it. yeah. no use to draw on the board itself. it's just slows down. yeah. yeah, even harder to draw like this than black board style. yeah. you cou you could draw on it, but not as main function. we did it. new ideas found. oh i just think if we uh i dunno. for remote control, a favourite for your text. that's for. yeah, this this is just the idea phase, the yeah. details uh quite early. oh, what do we have to do now. do we uh i thought we were done at four o'clock? yep. mm we can do it afterwards, so yeah. i found it as well. one two three four five six seven cameras. mm not bad. so that was it. this is the old versions. they went for uh for a universal device. yeah, but also a different device. then an l_c_d_ uh would be handy. yeah, and touch screens for all our stuff, yeah. i do agree with that. yeah, tu-dum. english is not so hard by the way. well, leader? project manager? you do? yeah, you have to make a choice. wow, that's pretty quick. uh uh um you have to decide. it's the lower one. no no, the upper one is the bomb. yes. i knew it. no. that's too much work. come on. i challenge you. no, you gotta use the magic pen. hmm. what if i put one there? we'll see. i don't agree. yeah, you had two choices. that's gonna be draw. or not. i'll put it here. you are going to put it there. then it's a difficult choice, either here or there. ugly. oh a pen. yeah, but then do it correctly. stupid, the l_c_d_ screen. what? okay, i'm going to guess what you're drawing. no no, the new one. uh they just don't save it. a house? yeah, you have to use the pen s stupid. no, not everything. pen, select select pen. okay. it's a house. a plant? oh yeah, i can know it. it's a okay, that makes it easier. i think i know. no, wrong. i think i know what you're trying to draw, but it's wrong already. yeah, you missed the right side. no, you're wrong, you're wrong see where you're wrong now? the entrance. alright. you're correct. yeah, but i think oh no you made another mistake. no i w okay, i'm not that whiny. but uh there was a big hole here as well, and there as well. that's a kinda big mistake. warning, finish meeting now. guys, i think we have to finish the meeting. uh? what does it say? come on. yep. oh you gotta finish over there? in your own room? i'm gonna be so lonely. mm i'll clean that up later. what's that?
okay. okay. oh, okay. yeah. yeah, and or are we making a slide open, like underneath? or fold open? i don't know. it's probably better. yeah, s like underneath uh you can slide it open and you other functions. yeah. think that's better. the yeah, i i think so. i don't know. ah okay. yeah. yeah, it's let's do it together. okay. yeah, we just made a word file with the basic elements. uh the look-and-feel model. uh well the form, the case um as drawn there. simply a square with uh round corners. so that's basically it. uh the material should be hard plastic. uh colour changeable, and also transparent. and colour and transparent, or just transparent, i don't know. um then the elements. uh we have the functions are just basic. like uh i've pointed them here. mute function, on-off function, text functions. this uh switch channel. and this is the the num-pad. and the logo is over here, and the mic. and the scrollwheel, no? you operate that with your pointing finger. so you hold it like this in your right hand and uh i dunno. yeah, maybe maybe uh you have to configure it. yeah, or or on the slide function, i don't know. well we haven't had time to design that, the slide pad. yeah. um the position? yeah, you write uh you wrote this, so. yeah. but it's not uh impossible to use it, if you're left handed. so y because you can use your thumb then. mm yeah. yeah, okay. just so you get that. yeah. yeah, these are just basic functions, so all the non-basic are in okay. um okay, maybe we use this button for the yeah. a second level? like a a new blank one or or just here? okay. yeah. so what do we need? yeah, just god damn it. so this is the extern or something. so here are multiple speech buttons, i don't know how many. i don't know the functions. okay. what else? what else? uh menu. uh with arrows. like a normal um yeah, with in the middle um a menu button. okay. yeah, okay. we can put those here. so did we miss anything? okay. oh wh here? okay. yeah, or th or the yeah. yep. yeah, but then you can switch back to normal telete teletext. you just switch it off and then well w we thought of a text button. and if you press it again, you get the the the through view. yeah, b but but if you're in the second stage, the third stage is switch teletext off. so you can switch back from second to w first. okay, okay. yeah mm nee uh no, if i uh the remote can send like the the code for seven hundred, page seven hundred to the television. th th th if you switch it on. th i yeah, i dunno. okay. yeah, those memory functions. yeah. was uh this logo for uh volume? okay. so that's it? mm. no no yeah. just hard plastic. so uh i think just um yeah, but i think uh you have that problem more often with rubber buttons. in the bottom. no, evaluation is yeah beautiful's is also a matter of taste. and what colours should the buttons be? but can you change those too, with uh the switch? okay. yeah. it's ju so subjective. one more thing. are w are we changing uh or are they there uh backlights on the slide panel too? or n no back light? yeah? and and the switch channel is uh there is a back light too? yeah. hmm. yeah, just backlight. not not the buttons. and th and the the normal backlights also not the buttons, but behind the buttons. so the buttons are just grey. okay. no, but you don't have to use that. and you on don't have to pay attention to that second layer. that's th that's the main thing that's so good about it. well, i think it is. so so few information that you can easily decide what buttons w for what function. mm uh. the normal. and the one you showed is just all buttons and you don't know yeah. the speech function and the colour. colour. mm it's pretty new, i think. speech is new. yeah. yeah, we didn't draw that too, but yeah, that's just a normal th s simple thing. well it's a already in the folder. l like number seven. i think it is. no, i think it is. okay. mm two, i think. yeah. we've got a one for fancy look-and-feel, and that's what attracts the young audience. so think that's a two or a one. yeah, but s it that's basically not not handy. and i don't thi i don't see yeah. yeah. no. yeah, you could make a a front a front that's that's like uh like a banana, or something. like a a f banana kind of front. no. yeah. eleven divided by six. we're not too hard on ourselves. okay. okay. yeah, but uh we have to make a speaker then too. if you want to make it beep. but we can we can do it uh underneath the logo. if you do uh yeah, okay. mm okay. but uh is uh uh okay. but but is it inc does it include a a homestation or can we make that for uh h twenty cents? yeah. yeah, it's four. it's kind of weird that we we get this information now, afterwards. because sure. beautiful. yeah m if we got a high mark for um uh innovativeness or innovativity then there we probably have been creative. yeah. huh. no, i think yeah. just normal discussion, i think. not one leader or something. yeah. and make notes. yeah. yeah, w we had so much information, that we get through email and just yeah. yeah, th that's weird. hmm hmm yeah. so we're bacal basically just lucky to uh get the price right. yeah. yeah. yeah, i if if it would be faster, it would be great. yeah. yeah, and p just point with a mouse. yeah. just old fashioned kinda blackboard style. but you might as well do it in normal computer style. yeah. yeah. and it's far too slow this way. no. what's that? hmm. yeah, but still, you couldn't make a fancy a f you couldn't make a a prototype out of this. because we don't have any sizes and yeah, but it you can't possibly do that in such a short time, i think. yeah, just brainstorming basically. so are we finished? okay. yeah. oh okay. it's now quarter past three. so yeah. now we can look at this. we're probably not supposed to look at this, but yeah, from the previous group. the touchscreen, yeah. yeah. hmm. here are the basic functions in here, the selecting dev devices. hmm. no. yeah, this one. hmm. this is a very interesting design. well it has a l_c_d_, i think. and what else do we have? yeah, everything. it wants to know what we do in our spare time. warning. finish meeting now. warning. warning. okay. boom-boa-ring-bing. fill in the questionnaire. what now? okay. no more chit-chat. yeah. okay.
oops. mm-hmm. means okay. just just one thing now. um y you need to have more uh one two th you've got one two three four five six seven eight nine. but you missed the no uh the zero and uh the two stripes. okay, but it's rather important. okay. ah. okay, there is one uh function i use uh daily, and it's not on the basic functions. it's uh to switch to uh uh your scart. play station or uh d_v_d_ player. that function must be yeah, maybe or you can uh i uh lay it uh beneath in the uh other uh functions. and h how does the second level come out? uh it slides uh along? from from the uh beneath? menu? scart? uh yeah. and so y you keep you keep one, you have one left. yes. yeah. it's a f basic uh yeah, to navigate. mm okay. maybe one button to switch the colour of your uh leds? uh and and you can hold it, you can hold it, and then the colours switch or mm multiple multiple buttons. okay. okay, yeah. th yeah. if we have enough place, uh then we can do that. colour buttons. and then we choose green, uh blue and red or okay. okay. that's uh um it some text uh buttons. yeah, but there's one there's one text button i there's one text button i prefer. that's the one uh that you use if you search for a page, uh like seven hundred, uh and it's counting from one hundred to two hundred, you will switch to your television and back to text. do you do you did you think of that? ex yeah. yeah. the sta the state you yeah. no. just remember where it was. it it doesn't uh uh clear the the page. if you if you turn teletext on, you you set the seven hundred, and you turn it off, then the next time you turn it on, it still stays on seven hundred? but maybe it's not the way mm. that's maybe one thing we can discuss about. mm most new t_v_s do uh collect all the pages. but uh not not every every television, so yeah, i i thought about one thing. uh the buttons? uh from which material are they now? okay. because um if you use it a couple of years, some uh sometimes the numbers on the on the buttons are slide away, are uh and maybe we can write the numbers below or above? or shall we just turn it on on the buttons? well yeah. that's too much place. okay, just leave it. just leave it. yeah, and i the most time yeah, with rubber buttons. yeah, okay. okay. fine. yeah, i made some criteria uh, so we can uh ev evaluate our model. i d d d i don't think if it's right. that shall show it. mm-hmm. uh no, uh all criterias we just argue about. uh oh. yeah. evaluation crit yeah, evaluation presentation. it's not in. uh d it doesn't matter um it only had two pages or something. um well i looked in the reports um from the marketing strategy, or uh of uh the the the the the the new needs and uh the market. the italians uh, how they think about it. and the research uh about uh the the comp uh the the the users and that kind of stuff. i made some criteria, and we have to test the criteria from one to zero. we sh we we we can give it uh a number, and then we can give ourself an average for our um model. and this these are all i i i found, or i wrote down. and um we have to discuss about, if we give it a one or a seven. uh yes. yeah, the the the difference be between uh beautiful and fancy uh look-and-feel is uh the the the outside uh beautiful uh like the ipod or something. and fancy's more like the mm uh f the flashing lights and the colours and and that kind of stuff. the leds. yes. and and what ki what kind of what kind of basic colours uh were you thought uh of? the basic colours are black or green or yellow? or you haven't thought about ho how do we make uh black and yellow. can black white, maybe? uh because um okay, so what uh number do we give uh a beautiful? beautiful is uh really subjective, uh because it has to do lots with the colours. changeable fronts, so ev for everyone for everyone it's something beautiful. yeah. a two. okay. the fancy look-and-feel. that's about our uh flashing lights and the background uh lights uh from from from the buttons. okay. and we can change the colours, so that's uh really fancy i think. so slide panel? oh, you mean th this here? it's pretty cool. if you slide it open, it lights up. that's that's really fancy, but i don't know if it's reachable. then we do it. yeah, but okay. okay, fine. so i i think it's very fancy. so i'll give it a yeah, and you can uh also choose your light, so i think it's one. okay, next. learnable? easy to use? yeah, we shall test it but uh yeah. learnable? it's not not as fast as a usual uh uh remote control. because because i think i think the scroll wheel, uh it's very handy, but the first time you get this thing in your hands, it's not to use the scroll wheel. i think uh you must uh seek for it, and up or down or uh then the re yeah. okay. okay. but yeah. but we we've got the two so two uh two or three uh new things, huh? and maybe we uh maybe learnable is in uh compare of old fashion uh remote controls. so we h we have speech, uh the scroll wheel, and um the the the slide. you must slide it. and that's not normal at the uh normal remote controls.
