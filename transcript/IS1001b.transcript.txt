okay everyone's ready. so we are here for uh for uh functional design. okay? so we are here for the functional design meeting mm so first i will show the agenda so we will uh i will take notes during this meeting so i will try to summarise it and put that summary in the shared folder if you want to look at it afterwards so then uh each of you will uh lead a presentation on the task that has been required last time so user requirement specification, technical function design and working design. then i will uh present you some new project requirements i received from uh the management board. then we will take uh the decision on on the remote control uh needed functions and then i will assign you the task for the next part of the meeting. of the of the process. so uh who want to start the the presentation of what they did? you can start. you have uh powerpoint? ah yeah maybe there. okay. who are you? ouch. and we have a technical problem uh. you put it on yeah. you have no over. okay. there's no we have a technical problem. if you remember yeah but that's yeah. yeah. okay. okay so special navigation, linear access, random access and there's a fourth one no? so the better now for special navigation? okay. then linear access then random access. ah yeah parameter okay. okay. okay. okay and and voice command did you uh okay. okay. okay. so that's uh that close your investigations? okay. okay. maybe we can have a look at the user requirements with i dunno if i can open it. maybe you can s it's messenger no? in which folder? short-cut to ami shared folder? maybe you can send it to me by email. just to participant one. at ami. i will try to show it to everyone, that would be more comfortable. you send it? yeah. uh this is this email. okay. so maybe i can switch slides when you whenever you ask, that will be more convenient. so okay, functional requirements. mm. yeah. we can just keep doing that? yeah. okay. okay. okay. okay, so fewer buttons maybe would be good? okay. yeah. yeah but in fact we it it seems that we are going to make a t_v_ remote control according to new requirements i received from the management bo i will present them in the following. okay. yeah. to find it. yeah. yeah. okay. what is her other side? oh yeah? i did not knew that. okay so you we have to make it uh more ergonomic yeah. it's your job oh. uh sorry got a message from microsoft. yeah. yeah yeah. yeah. okay. yeah. okay. yeah. this function should be very uh accessible. yeah, okay. this is the main function okay. yeah. yeah. yeah. to have l_c_d_ and voice. okay. yeah maybe this this is important. moreover th maybe those uh like those teenager customer could advice their parents to buy this equipment and so we can we have to take care of that point of view i think or so. yeah. okay. yeah. okay. okay these are the user requi yeah. no no no. we w it seems that we no want to have a t_v_ remote control. from the management board i receive an email. cos it would be costly uh and and also it it would take more time to develop to have a a general generic remote control. that it would be too long to develop. oh yeah. because i received that email from management board and they seems to tell that that if we want to be on the market as early as possible we should uh focus on t_v_ more where it seems that the market is more important. so maybe it's a good decision. i dunno. what's your opinion? okay. maybe you can go to the whiteboard if you have some drawings to do i don't know. okay. are you okay? u_c_ is the central unit? okay yeah. computation. okay. okay. okay so this is quite easy. there is not that much constraints. to have a you s you speak about with voi voice control? standard button one. so do you have any idea of how long it would take to have voice recognition now? okay so i it's a bit long yeah. one month for the standard one with button. even if we have a l_c_d_ display? okay yeah. okay so we can take this into account. so who think it would be good to go for uh like speech recognition? yeah it will. euros. yeah, yeah. well each unit is is sell uh twenty five euros. because we are it seems that that we want to sell like four million units from the first meeting. okay. maybe we can uh we can look at the new requirement i receive from the management board and discus discuss all function we want to have. yeah i i will continue. well ask your question if you want. okay. it's not intuitive first. yeah. but, but also it seems that yeah. yeah. yeah. maybe it would be more complex to configure it to be simple than creating a simple product. yeah. but also we we see that that most people find it find remote controls too complex because they have too many buttons and they mainly use only channels and volume buttons. so we may just uh make a very easy to use remote control with mainly those buttons and maybe also um some lightning stuff too because most people find also hard to to find the remote control. losed lose it etcetera. these these are these two points are the main frustrations so maybe if we design something very simple and easy to uh find when lost it will uh add uh a serious competitive advantage without making something too complex and too long to develop. so but le let us see first the new requirement. so we don't have to so this this uh is uh is um in the this is in the same direction as we were speaking so we don't have to make a very complex remote controls to access teletext and stuff like that yeah but then you have to you have to define the buttons to surf amongst pages and stuff. yeah. so well yeah. so anyway we don't have to include this feature because it's it's not used any more by users, they prefer to s yeah. i dunno. if i one button is still one more button. if if if we want to make it very simple we have to reduce number of buttons compared to th to our competitors. well anyway i have this point. we can discuss. also um so as as i told before uh it would be better if it's only for the t_v_ um because we want to be quick on on the market. and then also we have to make very uh uh clear that this uh this remote control is is part of of our products and show our corporate uh logo and and colours on the on the design as well so that uh they identify it as one of our product. so this is the the key point. so before uh finishing we can uh define uh what would be the characteristic of the o th of the control of the remote control and which button do we need which function do we want etcetera. so do you um so so from from the the marketing expert i think a key aspect is the easy to use aspect, it should be very simple and most button are never used only ten per cent of the button are are used often so i think we have to do something very simple and i think we all agree on that point, no? yeah okay. so yeah the key point here is simple. maybe. so few buttons, channel, volume control and what el what function do you see in addition to that? yeah. maybe switch t_v_ on and off yeah. yeah. volume, maybe a mute button, and then on off button. and that's all? mm. okay. yeah this is cool. maybe we can include that also. previous previous channel button. so we have like channel button, the previous channel button, the volume button, plus a mute button, and uh just the the traditional on off button. yeah. i i talk about that, yeah? yeah. incremental definitely because zapping you you switch them. we go faster? mm. maybe we should have also a digit button yeah. maybe we have also to have digits or only incremental. i dunno bec because if you have the uh. yeah. because you have your previous channel button if you have incremental only it's not uh it isn't worth it because the previous channel is eith either minus one or plus one. so i think we need also digits. maybe we we can make very obvious the channel and volume button button and smaller button down there with the the digits. yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah. maybe we can have a wheel for incremental. okay. so have a wheel for incremental, have the digits uh on the lower side that can be closed so as you say protected, and uh yeah i think this is the basi and do we do we have a no, a wheel is better. i would say the wheel is better. what is the expert of uh okay. yeah. that's a good idea. well also we have to decide uh so it should be lightening in the dark i think because most people lost their remote control. okay. yeah, and do we put an l_c_d_ display? because it was important for young customers if you remember. okay. so no l_c_d_? and so no speech as well because it w it would delay too much the development process. yeah. that would be cool. but eight months is really long and maybe we can just uh okay. so um i i will uh i will so i we will move to next meeting so in after the lunch break uh here are the individual uh action uh you are required to do but you will be uh recalled to the actions by uh email i think but you can take notes if you if you want but well the instruction will be sent. so thank you for uh your suggestion and i i will make a summary of that meeting that i will put in the shared folder you can't see and uh and then you will um you will be able to to see what has been uh has been said on on this meeting and and what has been decided. uh maybe for next meeting uh send me your presentation before by email so that we can see them uh altogether. that would be easier. no it did not work. she send it to me by email. so maybe this is better, to send it by email. okay? so yeah i i'm it's in the first uh email so i'm participant one at ami uh where is that, it's here. participant one at ami. okay. so see you after lunch break.
hello. make a start yeah. so. cable, camera. should be in my in their folder no? up. um at three i think. no? mm. do we think w s in the in the wrong folder maybe? it is possible. it was somewhere in something like this. i don't remember the name actually must be something like messenger ami or something. go up. yeah go up. again. no. go back. uh maybe messenger ami. messenger. no. there is nothing. let's go and check. i'll go and check. okay. yeah. yeah. so uh. basically what we want here is a remote control right. so um the question well first of all what to control. so most people want to have a a remote for their hi-fi and t_v_ and stuff like that. and but other people want th also remotes for controlling uh and toys like robotic pets and little robots and stuff and other people also want to have remotes for controlling um whole house. yeah, so there's a project i think called x_ house or something like that that does that, uh you can integrate your remote with uh computers stuff. so there is one that is one thing. the other is the the finder feature yeah by whistling or whatever. uh if you have the finder feature then you can also have uh at the same time as and general voice commands if you want yeah. so i think it should be a package in that case. uh so the user interface will consist of two parts. one is the voice command part and on one is the actual buttons part. uh and th the buttons part would be uh a set of buttons for choosing devices, a set of buttons for special navigation in space, a set of buttons for linear access of medium and a set of buttons for random access. yeah? like a video tape goes forward, backwards, uh fast and stuff yeah. um. mm? yeah. for special navigation for example you might have a t_v_ in the menu and you going to change yeah? uh. mm. yeah and also parameter changing. so if there are common parameters maybe we should put special buttons for that um or maybe we could have everything uh generic but uh there are a lot of uh remotes on the market right now and basically this is most of the almost everybody has this stuff. voice command w we could specify anything. we could assign any button a command to any button, if we have enough processing power, i guess so. yeah. yeah. yeah. uh yeah i think so. not so far. where did you put it? mm. i'm designing the user interface. but what kind of remote controls did you look at? what kind of task was it? it was a t_v_? huh. uh-huh. ah! good. other side yeah, yo wa your wrist. it i can become painful you can have tendonditis. yeah. if you also up on a computer in a strange position. ergonomic. but uh. have to say ha ha. mm-hmm. the first question. mm. mm. mm i it's not true i think. the the second claim that you put. yeah. i think that should be the same. i have uh i've no idea i mean i should know a bit more about how fast we can uh design it. i don't think uh yeah. yeah. okay. yeah. yeah. like a you feel a bit like a dog with this stuff. this will think this will take more time to develop also. yeah. soon. yeah. so the only time problem is the sp voice recognition. yeah. yeah. ten years. but we don't have time to market. i think we should contact management. well. uh how muc how much do you get how much do you if you buy one million units h no, one hundred thousand units. eh chips. we're gonna need chips right. yeah. how much will it cost for one hundred thousand? okay. so you have any idea for a powerful one that has uh good enough for do speech recognition. yeah? okay. so. no it doesn't. okay. four million. mh-hmm. a a lot of people are uh if you have the l_c_d_ screen if you can do it completely the way you want because the buttons also look the way you want them but it will be hard to configure i mean imagine i uh so it's really something for the expert user. so i mean there are markets and markets. i think the young people are th uh are uh christine here said uh you have a uh it is yeah. so for our young people uh it will be cool, they can be able to use it. th maybe their parents will not but they will configure it. i guess. i don't know if there is study about that. mm. and there are another thing is that if we make something that's simple and easy to use that's bas to use immediately that means that it will be exactly the same as everything else. all right? otherwise, if it's different then of course everybody has somebody has to learn to use it first. mm-hmm. yeah. mm-hmm. mm-hmm. but teletext is just one button. you you just write the write the numbers. so will you add with the channel keys, right? so. i am. i'm sure that uh it don't like but uh i don't see just one button. so. mm-hmm. capital. well if it is going to be just a t_v_ remote control it is going to be very simple. well if it's going to be as simple as possible then just have the remote control, there is no other function that i can see really. uh no you want to keep television on so that the advertising can revenue can come back to us. or something. it's a memory, yeah. and uh and of course the channel changing buttons. how should they how should we implement that? because uh could be numerical only or could be also incremental. mm-hmm. mm. it's an interesting idea, that if you press it for a long time it does something else, in general. so if you you have your ten buttons for the for the numeric the numerical buttons and you have instead of having just one memory you have if you press them for a long time no. doesn't work does it. maybe we should have a complete keyboard and just type console commands. change channel to eight. no. well if it's useful like if if you want to change between three channels for example then you h you cannot you cannot cannot work with just memory being incremental. yeah. yeah. yeah when you zap usually you will have to press the same button all the time and yeah. mm-hmm. hey i just thought this thing there is a i mean you know there is are some with a wheel like this. instead of having the up down buttons for uh you can have the wheel. yeah. yeah. mm-hmm. on the lower side i think it you have to turn it. no? if we do that. yeah. because of that because it's uh it's it's not like a volume which is smooth yeah? the channels change one by one. so you have to the user has to like to should feel the the the discrete sense a bit. yeah. yeah. even if i l_e_d_ uh or a if if it's the l_c_d_ feature uh whatever, yeah. yeah. i think it's only put on if cou have multi function. if you do not multi function then there is no p point in having l_c_d_. just increase the cost. the user does not have an advantage really. well if it's going to delay yeah but uh it will be cool. it would. because a user could say c_n_n_ for example and it would go c_n_n_. mm. yeah. yeah. what is the folder that you put yours in? and did it it did work? ah yeah. mm. okay. okay what is your email? at participant one. okay. well during lunch break actually. so next time we should have a fight. how about uh management or something. who happens to be your friend.
okay. f do you want to start? okay. no. what do you have in short cut? participant two. yeah. otherwise, could you just describe by hand? with the the whiteboard? mm-hmm. mm-hmm. mm-hmm. mm-hmm. okay. mm-hmm. mm-hmm. mm-hmm. what do you mean by linear access then? ah. mm-hmm. mm-hmm. mm-hmm. i'm just thinking of some thing. um we want to have a no, i don't know if this is a good idea. we want to have a a general remote control for everything. okay. yeah. yeah. yeah yeah. yeah. no no. finish tonight. but basically yeah maybe i can continue with my presentation, it would be al you you but i think we have some technical problem or so. so i'm just going to describe briefly what we do in the remote control. if fact yeah but do i have oh yeah. now i have enough cables. okay so i'm just going to describe in fact for for a remote control this is quite easy. we just have sorry, i'm going like that. i'm just going to describe. basically we have a a battery a power supply here. after that we just have um user interface. let's say that um something like that, which could be um a l_c_d_ let's say or um an array of push button, something like that. push button or a l_c_d_. after that we we feed that into um uh an electronic chip. so i say u_c_ and i feed that to uh l_e_d_ which is uh infrared um which is a an infrared um component. and so what we for for myself this for for us this is quite easy. yeah. y it's a it's this just a chip which does all the um numerical numerical computation according to your display. and so for us uh this is quite easy. we just need to take to define what we want to do when the user interface um wants something and after that we just do the coding to s and send that to to to the not the to the television. so for us this is quite easy. yeah. um we just have to define the processing power that we need uh especially if we want to do some uh speech recognition, in that case that mean that we are going to use more for simple yeah of course of course. and um but for a standard one this is really easy. it's a question of one month and so on s no no no no, i say yeah standard uh standard remote control takes maybe uh one month to to do that. yeah. definitely. i would say. i would say uh about eight months to have the first results. yeah. i can um. yeah. yeah even. i mean that this is really standard devices now. um eight. for uh speech recognition. and also how much uh i think during the kickoff meeting you say that we we shouldn't we shouldn't go up to twelve point five euro per unit so how many units should we sell to have a yeah but how many yeah. yeah. usually this is less tha at two dollars per chip. yeah, we can mm-hmm. um i just had a question uh do you want to continue with your presenta? is it um you say that i don't remember by heart but thirty per cent of the tested people say that's it's quite difficult to to to use the remote control. do they say that this is difficult but for the same reason or do they have other reason? to to maybe to keep in mind maybe to access to that menu you should do something like that. mm-hmm. mm-hmm. and but yeah maybe and what about if we design a remote control which can be configure as you want? you say that i want, i have six button yeah. yeah. yeah. okay. yeah. mm-hmm. yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah. mm-hmm. mm. uh i know that som you say that many people are doing plenty of a lot of zapping. i know tha i discovered that when i did a quick look, uh they do now som they do something which is quite nice now, you have a button, you you press it, and this is uh the previous channel which has come back. mm-hmm. mm-hmm. mm-hmm. let's say that we can do something like that. this is uh incremental, but once you press it for a long time, you go five by five. to go fa to go faster. yeah. yeah. okay. or we can do something like that. we can design the remote control to have access. you know some remote control have uh protection and so you you y you yeah, a kind of joystick. mm-hmm. or a or a ball, yeah, not a a wheel but a ball, and you say uh to yeah. yeah. yeah, the yeah. 's quite it's quite easy we do that w with back light on the on the wheel. a blue a blue l_e_d_ and we sell that um. yeah. mm-hmm. okay. ten years mm-hmm. okay. okay. okay.
mm. yeah. um i dunno if you can open the uh m is not here. uh in yeah okay. no. in document. mm computer yeah. here. here. but it's not um. mm-hmm. yeah, i can do that. okay. um. it's participant one? okay. you can uh. yeah. okay so you can you can go. okay so in our usability lab we observed the remote control use among one hundred subjects and the subjects also filled a questionnaire okay? and here i have the results so you can see that um seventy five per cent of users find most remote controls ugly so we have to find something to make them more more nice, more kind. eighty per cents of users would spend more money when the remote control would look fancy. eighty hundred per cent of users would spend more money when the remote control would look oh to it's not good. so okay. so it's not in theory but i i can i can say yeah. fifty f uh seventy five per cent of users say they s zap a lot. so mm we have to have a remote control uh very um out for that. uh the buttons have are to be um uh uh like you say resist resisting to to shocks. um and fifty per cents of users say they only use uh ten per cents of but of the buttons in the in the remote control. so all the buttons we we have to put are have to to have um a use a real use and not only or yeah. f not many buttons, and uh and uh uh u useable buttons. sorry? yeah. uh most for most is t_v_. 'kay you can go so. so there are other frustrations expressed by users, so they said uh they lost uh often the remote control in in the room so they want to have a way to to to find it. um and um lot of the time they it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control. so they want something s really very simple and uh easy to use. and uh remote controls are bad for r_s_i_ um i dunno. yeah. uh. okay um before that i i have some some some thing uh to say before um we know that uh the user use uh a lot their um remote control um to to change channel. um and um to to change uh volume selection of the and uh and not uh a lot for setting for setting the the channels and uh thing things like that. so it's better to put uh uh uh something very easy to set and uh and very accessible yes. that's right. so then we asked some questions to them and um we asked this question if they prefer an l_c_d_ screen or on their remultific function remotes control and if they mm pay more for speech recognition in remote control and you can go we have here the results of of the questions. so you know that um for the younger it's very important to have the s yes and speech recognition. and uh and the others is not so important but uh we know that uh uh people between fifteen and twenty five are people who watch a lot t_v_ and uh who who wh can use a lot this uh. so maybe we we can have a speech recognition in. yeah. mm. okay and if there is th the conclusion now. so as we say before, i think uh um a remote control lightening in the dark it's it's a good thing. uh not to many mud buttons like we we said before, e easy to use uh a way to find it easily in the room and uh uh resistant to to shock and to to an i s no, yeah. i dunno if you see something else important or mm. yeah. mm. mm. mm? yeah. oh. would j uh yeah w i i think they they say that it's uh difficult to learn how to use it but i when you know how to use it, it's it's okay. but yeah. mm. mm. mm. mm. mm. mm. mm. mm-hmm. hmm. mm-hmm. mm. no. no no. i dunno, i dunno it. 'kay thank you.
