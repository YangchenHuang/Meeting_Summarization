play-doh's edible. did you know that? it's definitely yeah. it's it's chew proof. yeah. yeah. right. everybody everybody ready? okay, let's have your um let's get have the uh presentation? nice. mm-hmm. mm-hmm. what button? um. oh mute. okay. that certainly does. mm. mm. yeah. 's great. i have one thing about it, but it's a small thing, but it'd mean we'd have to make a right-handed one and a left-handed one. but, that's i don't see why that's not possible. yeah. they make left-handed scissors, you know. yes s mm. sure. sure. yeah. yeah. but um other than that, i mean uh and that's um, you know, that's just something, i think i think it's great, yeah, great idea. i think it's, well, if the r_r_ motto is, we bring fashion to to electronics, i'd say that could be quite fashionable. yeah. yeah. yeah, very good, yeah. it's come up with what we've you know, the things that's what we've what we were looking at doing, hasn't it, all seems to be there. well done. um before we move on i need that cable. thank you. yeah. um. one thing i do need to do we need to look at, is the costs. well, yeah. um yeah. uh right. okay, now i think we'll do this i could do you know, i can do this o on my own or i could do it with you, but it's just easy enough to go through it with you, so we're going for the kinetic power. and the electronics, we decided on it being just a simple, the easiest thing that's inside it. ooh. so the case, we've gone for the double curved. um and it's made out of rubber. the interface is push-buttons. and button supplements well they're in diff special colours, aren't they? so special colours. special form, yeah, they're a special form there in shapes and stuff. yep. yeah. um. are they made out of any special material? no they're not. they're not made out of wood or titanium or rubber or anything, they're just simple okay. right. so let's see if that comes within budget. and it does. that is gonna cost uh yeah. that's gonna cost ten ten euro seventy cents a unit to make. and our target was it had to come in at under twelve fifty. so, this is all very very good. the bosses will be very pleased. okay, let's just save this so i can e-mail it to you. uh. save it in save it in the uh my documents. splendid. okay. so uh, that's done with this with this um doodah, so you're. gonna do what you were gonna do, your evaluation. f_ eight. i love the smell of that play-doh. i cou. i would give it a seven. oh sorry, one, d yeah. yeah.. yeah, but that's not a technological thing, that's another thing, i that's another marketing thing. so on the technical side of it it easy to use. i'd say it's i wouldn't not if you're left-handed it's not. i would give it a i would give it a two, 'cause i i it i it i it is more geared for right-handed people than left-handed people, but yeah. give it a t give it a two. cost. it's come in under budget. so that's a definite one. amount of buttons. contains only the necessary buttons. yeah. so it's anti-r_s_i_. i don't think it's gonna get lost easily. two. i mean it no, i mean i mean, you could still flush it down the toilet theoretically, but okay. alright it's all all systems go. we can't fail.. well done, reissa. okay, i i think um i just wanna put in as project manager the you know, little bit of praise for everybody here for how they've worked on it, you know, both individually and as a team. you know you've w everyone's come up with their own individual ideas in their own different departments, um and then come together and worked in, you know, integrally, you know, at the right times, psp, you know, especially you two. that's all, you know, gone very very well and and and be you know, has been good communication going on. did you have to go down to the the corporate squash court and bash a few balls about? fantastic. i think so i i, you know, and i think we've co we have come we've come up with something new, something that hasn't been done before, we haven't we're not just rehashing an old design. yeah. you know, maybe this isn't a simulation, maybe this is actually so it's like sony or someone like that they're they're just, yeah, they get yeah. yeah, two years' time this will be on the market. ex exactly that product um thum we'll go, yeah, we designed that and no-one will believe us. but um no, i think when this meeting's finished like officially, there b we'll get a uh questionnaire to fill in. or six, uh i haven't got message. it gets handed over to another department. what our what our project was was to come up with the product, basically. the for the and just basically is it it come can is it within budget. when it c when it comes to all the other things of how to sell it and, you know, the b the profits and all that that's other departments it's another team that actually work out the mai the oh yeah, the all the guys in the profit sharing, yeah. um. yeah, that's it. you know, we've we've we've made i we've made we've designed the product, we've ma we've got the prototype, it's within budget, it's does everything that we wanted it to do. it's new, it's it's um something that uh that isn't out there already. yeah. well, this is very marketable in that it is it's it's something that's kind of new and looks a bit quirky for people who want that, it's that it's um, hang on, i wrote it down here somewhere oh no i thi i put it in one of my e-mails that i sent off. um that, you know, it's marketable in the sense that it's whilst all these other remotes uh actually do give you repetitive strain injury, our one does the complete opposite, you know, so that's something that's new, which is one of the criteria they asked us to come up with something with something new. yeah, and if you're not having a good time with the t_v_, you can f throw it about, you know. it's fine, it's kid proof. well, you can break the ornaments, but you won't break that. yeah. so all in all, i think we've done very well. well done everybody. um. drinks are on the company. in the corporate bar that's next to the corporate swimming pool on the top floor that we're that've all just gained access to. yeah. that's it. well, as far as i t as far as i know. um. no. anyone wanna play i spy? yeah, i guess. i mean we're gonna get asked to fill out another questionnaire. um. it's probably gonna be the same as one we've done before. but i'm not the authority to say that it is. um how does everyone feel about the technology that's been used in this? the sort of using of the the pens and writing on these special pads and all that? yeah. i thi you know, i'd i'd n yeah, as we said earlier, i've not never seen that before. something that t the whiteboard thingy, that's great. um, but a p a pen with a camera on it, i don't think it's such a new thing. i mean it's i or in such a new idea. it would be different if it was sort of hand writing recognition stuff, but as it's not it's literally that'll come up on a computer screen as a picture file rather than actual text. yeah. yeah. mm. yeah.
i used to eat it. yep. we've got a cool prototype. double curved. which is ant anti-r_s_i_. oh right, yeah. yeah, i know i know people who have left-handed and right-handed people in the family and they all use the computer for the whole the same computer the fes family and they have a mouse, and everybody is using right-handed mouse. imagine d are you right handed? imagine you're doing it with your left hand, i don't think it's too but we can have both uh yeah. i think it does. yeah. there you go. play-doh is very cheap. chew proof. oh ho-ho. yep. rubber. yeah.. mm-hmm. a one. well, the kinetic thing, yeah. well so the um yeah. yeah. yeah. true. two. yeah. mm. yeah. yeah. yes s yeah. it's yellow. two. t mm. mm. we've, we've done well. well. you know it is. y oh really? mm yep. cool. glad to hear that. yeah. yeah.
i've, i've definitely eaten it before. i didn't know was edible.. actually that makes sense, because i remember like, peopl i dunno if my mom ever did it but i remember other people's moms making like home-made play-doh where you just like make the colouring and make some sort of sort of dough. mm-hmm. yeah. we've got some. yeah, it's pretty exciting. so, everything uh that we wanted we wanted it to be ergonomic and to be made out of rubber, very simple and easy to use, yeah, double curved, um but also something that was gonna jump out at people, something that would be different uh, separate it from the other remotes out on the market. so uh i think if you put this in the palm of your hand, you'll see what a nice thing we have going here. so, basically, if you hold it like that, the one on your thumb, yeah, the thumb button is the power button. your index finger is channel up, middle finger is channel down, ring finger is volume up, your pinkie is volume down. that's the lock button, has a l_ l_ on it and then the m_ is a mute button. and then it also has digit for muting the uh um and then then you can also there's a numeric keypad on the top so you can key directly to the to the channel if you want. so it's really basic functionalities as far as what keys are available, but we think it's very comfortable and very innovative and it looks different. so all the, i mean the important keys are right at your f f you know right at uh at a convenient place for you to to access them. so you don't you yeah. it should be. and it's also conformable to the size of your hand. i mean if that's too big, it's a rubber remote, so you can, you know change that. so d does that uh what mesh with what you guys were hoping and for and expecting or does it ah, that's good thinking, yeah. yeah, if we build rocket ships why can't we build left-handed and right-handed uh remotes. yeah, i didn't i didn't think about that, but i'd yeah,. uh-huh. yeah. do you think it says r_r_? fashion to electronics. yeah. yeah. and it's got the b the black and yellow and blue. plus red, which is sort of a a fruit and vegetable uh uh. so that's that's our end of things wha uh that's yeah. the costs, was that what you said? but it's edible. that was the main criteria from the last meeting, it had to be chew proof. yeah. yeah, i mean, these these ones on the side are curved kind of, so the buttons are rubber. that's cool. yeah. yeah. and we're actua actually making a better profit than we expected. yeah, have some have some. mm-hmm. mm. yeah. oh, sorry, one. yeah. that was our main technological innovation w every everything else was fairly simple, but the fact that we used the kinetic energy was new. it's ergonomic, but that's not that's that's a design that's a des that's a design thing, yeah. it's about in the mid in the middle somewhere, maybe, yeah, i dunno. maybe three, yeah. yeah. mm. okay. if we're gonna have one left-handed and one right-handed then i would give it a one, but otherwise otherwise a two. yeah. that was great. yeah. it is very bright, yeah. it's not the kinda thing that's gonna slip like between a couch cushion or something, you know. maybe it will. uh. you think it could lost mm. okay. yeah, anything, i mean. okay. it's bigger than the average mobile, i guess. but, yeah, it can get lost. yeah. okay, yeah, two is fine. yeah, yeah. yeah. mm. yeah. yeah, during our design i mean there was some s some heated heated discussion, but we we kept we tried to keep it cool and and just just we just had to we just had to squeeze our product a little bit and now you guys have been a a great team. think we're the we're the envy of all the of all the other r_r_ teams,. yeah i think they're actually trying to find ideas for a ideal remote. so at this stage, i mean, is this the last meeting of the project? we don't uh have another one after it's gone gone to marke market or something? so there's no way to like predict what our 'cause we had a we originally had a as far as our financial uh um goals, we had a specific number for profits that we wanted. it was fifty mil fifty million i don't remember. but there's not a way to compute that, i mean, since we saved on the on the production cost, do we know how much we're making on profit? uh. hmm. but we have a vested interest prof profit sharing. i think actually and one advantage of of this is that after the uh, you know, after this fad of fruit and vegetables passes this will still be c a cool remote, you know. we're not we're not you know, tying tying our cart to that one horse. mm. mm. mm. it make watching t_v_ healthy. uh. right, you too. mm. that's it. i guess it's probably better that we wrap it up than have five minutes of silence. should we call the day then? uh, right. mm-hmm. your moment to shine. right, i think they do want to do hand writing recognition on that, it's just the first step. i guess we should end this, since we're off off topic. so. shall we right.
it's play-doh. because kids yeah. but um, it's it's made edible 'cause, yeah. it's made edible 'cause kids eat it, and if it's wasn't edible then well, normal babies. oh yeah it is, yeah. oh yeah. that is cool. what's the big blue thing? oh cool. and mute. oh it's so cute. yeah, but then but then you can learn to use your right h like i was just thinking if there's left-handers and right-handers in the family, what, they have two remotes? yeah, i'm sure they'll be able to i mean it's only pressing buttons, you don't have to do anything, you know, extraordinary. i think everybody can press a button with their left and right hand so yeah, it's not yeah. have them in stock. make 'em more appealing as well.. and all the playing around is uh yeah, i'm just do you wanna plug in? okay. mm. play-doh won't last very long everybody'll go like, oops, it's gone. mm-hmm. mm-hmm. well, they'll buy more of them if you eat them,. yeah. yeah. it's better for and special material. well they're rubber, aren't they? we're under budget. it's already saved, i think. thank you. mm. oh, yeah. this is where we all get to i get to write on the, oops, on the board. right. oh. 's function okay. mm. okay. so, evaluation. we're gonna do it all together so we evaluate each criteria. i've got the criterias. and we have to do it on a scale of one to seven, one being true, so it's it's more like it's fits the criteria, and seven being as in it doesn't fit the criteria. and the criterias are, and i'll draw this up on the board so we have a box. and this is false, this is just like to keep you informed. so seven's here and one's here and then you've got in the middle. so the first criteria. do you all get what we're doing? okay, cool. okay, first criteria, look and feel. so the does remote look and feel fashionable to what we talked about? as it is it colour-wise and is it spongy? so what mark should we give for that? as in it's not. a one a one. so i'll just write criteria criteria one we get one. second criteria, new technology. have we implemented new technology? as in the new high-tech so it's. so we'll give it a yeah. i'd say it's about a a twoish? two. three. three. so criteria three is is it easy to use? i think it's a one, i think. two, so it's but if we make a right-handed and a left-handed then? yeah. yeah, okay. 'kay, criteria four is costs. 's great. yeah. like the amount of buttons, 'cause people like a lot le like so it's a one? um criteria six. r_s_i_ is it good against? yes. very good. it's one. and criteria seven, which is the last one, does it get lost? is it easy to get lost? no? but it is smallish. mm. i think i it would, could be, could get lost. mm. yeah. i mean it's not fully it's not fully like you can't say i mean, it's not a one, definitely. yeah. the mobiles get lost all the time. but then you ring 'em and you find them. so yeah. so, that's that. so that's the evaluation, so i'd say yay. it's like like a number one. um. number one product. all done, thanks. we fitted all the criterias. yeah. yeah, so so that's that one. been cool. in four diff in in four meetings. funny, all designer meetings could be this quick. they're using our ideas. yeah. just start summarising now. you can reply to the same message. see summary, there. if you just reply to that one. was it was it fifty or five? depends how much we sell. we finished an hour earlier. mm. mm. definitely. yeah. just don't sh don't throw it at any of the ornaments and break them. no. yay. yep. we haven't got the five minute left thing yet. mm mm. in project. i love it. i love it. i think it's cool. being all wired up and a vibrating pen and it's cool. being watched. um wow. mm. logitech. yeah. meeting adjourned.
