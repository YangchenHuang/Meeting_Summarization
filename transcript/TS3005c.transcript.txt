okay, welcome everyone to our next meeting. i'm busy writing and busy leading the meeting, but um i've prepared a little presentation once again um or at least an agenda i think uh the biggest part of the presentation will be uh on your side. um we are here at the conceptual design meeting, which is hereby opened. um once again i will try to uh write some minutes which i just from the previous meeting uh placed inside our project folder, which was quite some typing. um today we once again have uh three presentations, if i'm right, and after that we will take a decision on the remote control concepts. and just as the last time we have forty minutes to accomplish that. okay, well i'd say let's start with the first presentation. um in the same order as last time? okay. well, take it away. mm-hmm. well, business colours i thought it was the the slogan and uh the corporate image, so yeah, it needs colour, but i don't think you have to make the entire thing in the corporate colour. it must be recognisable. okay, thank you. mm. mm-hmm. thanks. now our third team member with his presentation. oh y so for the older people, a more traditional uh form. yeah, i guess changing colours will be easier than changing uh the shape of it. but maybe then both groups won't buy it. mm-hmm. yeah we think so too. hmm. so we need a spongy feeling. yeah. and we won't include a a pen, or something to point, hey, we we want to do it with our fingers, right? yeah. yeah but i think people want to use a remote with with their fingers because th they're used to that and and maybe we have to add a tissue to remove the grease from all the fingers, huh. okay well maybe, if i can interrupt you, maybe i should uh should show some points on which we uh should take a decision. so we can discuss these points. those points um energy question mark. how how should we uh supply the thing with energy and how are we going to do it with separate docking station and then put in it. uh chip on print and case. those are points my uh coach advised me to discuss here, but i hope you have ideas about them. yeah. so that's the the the first point. we already decided that on the previous meeting. mm-hmm. simple rechargeable uh batteries. yeah but how did this how does that with a l_c_d_ screen? you still have a print plate. mm-hmm. yeah well it's a good question. it just was in there and i didn't have any information about it, but mm-hmm. well you need some kind of c_p_u_, i guess. mm-hmm. because we're projecting projecting the buttons on the l_c_d_ screen. yeah. yeah. but that's what we want,. mm-hmm. yeah yeah you have a fancy design, then, right away. so okay so yeah but i wrote it down. what about the user interface, there are also some some questions uh about the concepts i think you have some ideas on that. you you showed your drawing. mm. everybody's searching in his data. yeah well i think we have we don't have to decide about that now how where we will put the buttons just the concepts. yeah well we just heard about the new uh technology, huh? mm-hmm. yeah maybe at the bottom where you can can hel hold it with you hand that there's also a microphone uh over there. yeah, yeah. yeah. well maybe just in the the spot you just pointed out because i think it should be in a in an important position where people can see it, because it is the the unique uh idea of our remote, huh, the the speech control. well maybe where the one hand but are we talking about the button, or about the microphone? yeah because a microphone is very small thing, but you can make it look like it's big so as its its really an important function of the remote. so well uh type, supplements, anything. yeah, well we already s discussed that, huh, the the l_c_d_ and mm-hmm. and i think i would it would make even more fancy because you have another interesting thing on the side which you can touch and yeah. okay. well there's our five minutes uh warning. um any more uh questions about about the design or the user interface or different components, everyone? everybody think they can can work for that? is there a standard colour? yeah. but still silver and black are well silver is new but also traditional, so uh yeah w what about a yellow thing, i mean it could be ugly, but it's definitely fancy. mm-hmm. yeah i would think about colours like uh red, yellow, green, blue, just yeah. mm-hmm. maroon. yeah. okay, so who's pinging? you are pingin okay. i thought we okay, so uh that wraps it up? everybody knows uh what to do? well i wrote it down here. i wrote it down here what to do um. the next meeting is once again in thirty minutes. um here are the individual actions, and especially notice that uh the industrial designer and the user interface designer are going to work together on a prototype drawing on a smart board, and of course to all four of us uh specific instructions will be emailed by our personal coach. well i i'd say just wait uh for email and uh find out. i don't know. okay well that was what i had to say, uh, final thoughts from anyone, or? we're finished. okay, well thank you very much.
mm. alright. hmm. it's a colour. no. you can put the r_ and r_. alright. i will go next. alright so i thought a little bit about the interface. uh how it should look. and uh uh we uh determined that will not be no buttons, but only an l_c_d_ screen, so i had to uh look on that. and the design is therefore based on what we just uh uh thought of. uh first there are some new findings and new technology for speech recognition. and this is that uh um uh uh you you ask you give a question through through the device and it answers you. and they already uh put this in an in a coffee maker. and so that it you say uh good morning, uh coffee maker, and it says t says to you back good morning joe or what's your name. this uh and there's an easy way to uh program that uh you say record into the device into the speaker and then you say the question and three seconds later you say the answer and then when you say the question it gives you the answer. um perhaps it's useful, perhaps for because people um lose the remote, they can yell uh remote where are you and calls or something. and perhaps we could uh implement that. and then i have to go out of the presentation because i tried to make some kind of a a idea of how it should look like but i can't draw, so uh don't make too much of it. i tried to uh the l_c_d_ screen i tried to sort of to draw. i thought uh at least uh the icon for the volume. i don't know if there is an icon for the program, but yeah. so uh and then the buttons above and uh below the and the and the mute button also recognisable as an icon. um. i forgot that one. i thought i forgot something, but uh. and uh and uh the numbers, that should be a bit larger i think it's not really on scale and and so forth. um an options button. and i thought the the button for teletext apar uh apart because it's not really options, i think. it's uh options is the settings of the remote and of the t_v_ and that kind of uh thing. so could call it settings or something. but this is a bit uh how i thought it. and uh the l_c_d_ uh somewhere on the remote. perhaps we could be more curvy the remote perhaps should, so that it's better in your hand or something uh. but uh and and uh a microph microphone for the speech uh recognition if we want to implement that. uh and then uh if you press the op options button, now we have an example of and then you should get the other options with what what you could do and that you could do with something like this this. and uh it's also uh i thought think we discussed uh earlier that uh older people don't really want to use uh these extra settings. and older people a also don't really want to use this uh th this kind of option menus. so they want to u use one button and then something happens, and not choose with uh this kind of uh and you could put in a an a really s little scrolling device on the side of your uh remote, so you could scroll scroll uh across these uh things. that's an option. and that was my uh finding dinge. yeah. grass green. let's build it into a sponge. it was one remote, i think, different colours. you could you could uh change the colours, that was also the idea. i don't know which shape you should should take, but. yeah. perhaps you could find something in the middle. round but square. yeah. uh i i if you do it uh uh square, with round corners but a little uh in the middle of it uh i do you know what i mean? wait, like like this uh a bit. so it's a bit square, but it's also a bit uh round. so but then same sides. but that's uh yeah but that's also how other remotes are shaped, so that's uh but perhaps that's a good thing, so that's easy to use. people know the yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah. swords. yeah. but that's easily to do with the colour, i think. that's easy to do with the colours, i think. yeah. yeah. yeah think uh also in between. i don't think you should be able to mould it, but yeah. bit like this kind of rubber. this uh but it's quite hard, this. yeah. i don't think it's rubber. uh did you have something about uh so we should first decide about shape, i think. which uh then you can fit the l_c_d_ screen in it, and can decide uh. yeah it it's supposed to be bit s bit s bit yeah. ooh yeah. but if you pu now you can put your hand there and then you won't touch the screen. perhaps that's best. but not on the screen because yeah that's uh that's an idea. looks a bit like a game boy now. you always touch it, yeah. yeah. y you could include a pen. yeah o yeah, if they think it's handy to use a pen. yeah i think this uh this is a good size for the screen. i don't know how how large the actual remote should be but a little bit like this, or something. yeah. i think energy were batteries and then uh and uh yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah. just like with the telephone. but it should be th i think normal batteries, not not like two or two uh yeah. yeah. um what was with the chip on print? yeah. it's rubber. yeah but but a hard rubber like this? or softer rubber or yeah. it bounces back from the floor where you throw it. yeah yeah this in different colours? yeah it's a bit. but i think it should be a bit longer, perhaps. yeah. i think so too. yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah, that's a good idea. yeah, alright. and then yeah, you can uh it's pretty easy but and yeah, i had what i just uh i should again. i miss a few buttons, but. well. at least uh what we should also have on, i just remembered, um a menu to go back through the first uh if if you touch options, you can't go back to this uh right away now. this i don't know. i think it's i don't know. i i thought it was uh easier to handle this way, but i don't know what they think. would you like the the buttons horizontal or v vertical? th right well if we make it like this, i think if you put it like this yeah. yeah. but i think i wou i think that's a matter of what you're used to. i think i would put a plus and a min uh here. and then the p_ in the mid in the middle and the sound uh in the middle. almost. yeah but i think when you are holding it, you could press the minus and the plus and with the other finger the minus and the plus. yeah but i think yeah i don't know. perhaps i have some examples. i don't know that's me. but i'm going to look if i've got some examples 'cause perhaps you should choose what's most often used. the 'cause they can use that better. yeah. i here is our here are uh i don't really know. yeah. yeah but but i mean if it's usually plus or min above each other or next to each other on a normal remote. w what's what's usual or normal. yes i'm looking here. but here's it's below, here also, and now here's here's next to each other. i think it's it's a yeah. i think the the the volume was usually uh above each other, because you go higher and down. and the the pay the the the program is next to each other, because you would go further and back. that's how it's is usually when i look here that's what i see. i don't know. yeah. this concept is in the actual design, but you should know where you would place a and the speech uh shall we implement that? or uh yeah. but then you should also find a place you could if you do it like this you could put it in a corner or something. you can talk into the corner. yeah. yeah. but yeah, that's also. so, in the middle or something. but you should uh decide where you want to put it. right? you could p you could put it in a logo of the company. yeah. yeah. so where do you want to put it? yeah actually it does because it you can you can find it better if you use it. it's a way for you to uh so it makes more sense just 'cause other remotes don't have that. about a microphone, there is no button. yeah. yeah. alright. any more uh yeah. yeah. yeah. um yeah. yeah the the young people do like uh scroll uh yeah. or at least yeah i don't know if it's really the scroll, but the menu they like most, and i think you can never get through a menu great with a scroll uh but you have it's f uh we have five or four or something. yeah. yeah. it's also different. you should you should have a black one because uh i think black is standard. but if you want to be different, then uh silver. silver rubber. but yeah. yeah. yeah. just all kind of colour. yeah. and and do we have to have a normal black one, or uh is it yeah. well i don't know what to do, but. ooh. right. yeah. but do we have to we'll work together, but do we have to stay here, or do we right. yes. okay. yeah i think. no. yeah. so we have to keep talking english now?
w sure. okay uh welcome you all. components design, um uh first of all uh i would like to uh uh accommodate some of those uh things i uh uh elaborate some of the things i did. i i elaborated on the concept. what should be um uh said about uh the components, uh its properties and what kind of materials should we use to uh to make uh one of those r remote controls. uh well first of all i've uh d subtracted some of the components that is that are used uh are w w um you know from what uh the remote control's formed. uh first of all, the case, the case, the surrounding of the of the the remote control. i would like to uh give you an idea of uh how i thought about. giraffe's gone now. okay um the case was is made from rubber, i suppose. there's one of the because when you use a remote control a lot of people uh will uh will uh drop their remote control and they break uh becau the uh titanium was also an option. but uh it's a very expensive material. uh rubber is, i think, uh the best suitable uh material uh to use uh for our uh for our remote control. um it's poss it's also possible to uh create fancy colours with rubber. uh rubber l makes it easy to uh to to it lets lets itself colour. uh titanium uh you have to paint it and with that uh it's possible to scratch it or uh yeah make it ugly. uh rubber uh the total uh piece of rubber that's sor uh that's that's used uh to make the case is uh the same colour, so if you scratch it it's still the same colour, perhaps uh it's a little bit damaged. but it's a very strong material. um i h i had an idea single covered uh curved, sorry, single curved. uh so it's t two dimensional. i think it's uh it's best to draw oh green. uh new. blank. okay. let's make it uh black. okay. i thought of an idea like this. oh that. um delete. blank. okay. so it also looks nice when it's on your table. so you get uh it doesn't lay flat down on the table, but it's c it's stands. side view yes it's side view so uh i i'm not technically good at th three d_ modelling, but. um uh it's just an idea i had so it's uh it's very uh so its also looks nice when it's on the table. um the graphical user interface and the buttons, uh we also thought about that already. uh i thought about uh the l_c_d_ touch screen, which is uh is easy to clean too. one of the great uh advantages of the l_c_d_ screen you just use some or uh another uh cleaning uh uh cl some cleaning stuff. and um it should be made of strong plastic and it should be bright. well i already uh s uh explained some properties of that material and i think uh well we also we almost concluded about that uh this should uh be uh our uh button component. so uh uh that's all about uh the buttons. uh the batteries, uh we also thought about that already, uh will be chargeable with uh uh an option for a mount station so you can uh put the uh the remote control in a mount station so its charges itself up instead of uh plugging it in or something like that. questions,? okay. and they should be long lasting, not uh not be empty uh in about uh two minutes or uh thirty minutes or forty minutes of use. and next step is the chip uh th the component that's uh makes or transmits the signal to the television. uh there was an option to use s a rather simple chip but i think uh because uh of our uh highly uh requiring uh requirements, there should be an advanced chip in it with uh also the ability to uh facilitate speaker speech recognition uh which unfortunately is still in a test phase, so uh there should be some more uh investigation on that side. uh my personal preferences uh i also overheard in the last meeting that there shou we should use uh our own business colours. that was correct, wasn't it? okay. i think they are rather boring for um for use with rubber. okay they should be m sh they should be in mind, wasn't it? okay so it d it doesn't says uh to uh have the slogan? okay okay. well that's possible of course. we could make a little r_ and r_ on the top of the machine. uh so they are pretty boring, i suggest, because just the availability with rubber to make fantastic colours uh and also in a lot of possible colours, so it's possible to make very uh fancy uh remote controls which peopl uh who people in which people will find they're uh interesting. and uh will buy uh them faster when they look at the same old grey or black uh colours. uh s as i said uh before rubber is uh is impossible to damage severely imp instead of uh of course you can break it when you you when you break it in s for example with a pair of scissors or something like that, but i if you drop it it's not uh broken uh right away s instead of using uh plastic, hard plastic or uh titanium. and i personally liked uh the single curved uh remote control, because it yeah it makes sense. okay. well that's all about my uh my findings. mm. mm. mm. oh my god. not just a p_. oh okay. ... ah. mm-hmm. yep. oh okay, yeah. oh yeah,. mm. okay. go danny, go danny. fruity? fruity. mm. okay. mm. okay. changing just the shape of the uh remote control? yeah, s round corners, but s but square, yeah. yeah. yeah i know what you mean, kind of like a. yeah. kinda like a beer glass. yeah. i know what you mean. it's also easy to to have to to put in your hand. yeah. will recognise that's as a remote control. uh when i saw your d oh. huh. yeah, kinda like old cars, uh let's put it all together. uh. yeah. soft rubber. yeah i know what you um. it should shouldn't be. uh. spongy. yeah. ding ding. um i also s uh can't help but notice that you uh used an you had a remote control and the l_c_d_ screen was uh rather small. um. ... this was your size, but i think it should be larger. yeah, three quarters. so uh so you don't have to put your oh. uh new, blank. so uh when you get this uh uh kinda like this. or should it be larger? larger? because you want to put your hands you want yeah. your thumb here. yeah. because when you put your f yeah but if yo if you make the the l_c_d_ screen as large as the remote control itself, uh you'll you'll always get some you yeah. going to be very greasy and stuff. yeah you don't want it too small. how yeah how large yeah they have thick fingers. but if you wanna make it in international, japanese uh people got uh rather small hands and we got these large zoom opt ah yeah of course, yeah. you can make it larger to to uh to uh with accompanying uh greater fields to push the button. your fingers, yeah. you don't want uh because if you lose the pen uh if you lose the pen uh you can't use yeah you can do whatever uh any uh cloth. sure. the docking station. w yeah. i kinda like your yeah you got some uh some of those uh uh wireless uh mice? mouse. computer mouse. kinda like those kind of batteries. yeah. the chip on print? um uh you gotta f yeah. i think so. chip on print with a with a simple uh a sim not a simple but a we also discussed that. didn't we? uh beg your pardon? yeah sure, of course, yeah. well uh chip on print, i think what they mean uh with the regular rubber buttons that you got, uh it's always clear for the remote control when you press uh a certain button. but when you got a l_c_d_ screen, with no uh with not the buttons are not always on the same place, for example if you enlarge a button, or if you got several options uh appearing on your screen, uh the co-ordinations aren't always the same. when you got a regular button, th the button of stand-by is always on the same place and you got on the and on the yeah. i suppose so. it is a simple c_p_u_ but it doesn't yeah because it has to uh b yeah but it the the remote control has to know whether you're in a settings menu or just uh you just want to turn up the volume. so it has to have some kind of a calculation unit or c_p_u_ to know uh in which state you are and uh which button you are pressing in at the right moment. yeah. and a touch screen makes it uh possible to uh to get the co-ordination of your finger on the screen. and the case, yeah we already discussed the case, we wanted to make it from rubber and uh uh hard rubber i think. that's the easy to ha uh to to uh yeah. yeah sure, look. d it's our main target. well and how about my idea uh of making it um with one single curve? so i because it's a gadget and you want to show it off, of course. uh. because it yeah. yeah. it's a lot easier. so, so you got uh did you write that down? uh got a single curved uh rubber f uh fancy coloured remote control. yeah. sorry? depends on the screen. if you make the screen vertical it doesn't matter. if you make it uh in a rectangle i so it's it's it's it's square. oh, okay. uh. take your time. w we'll leave that to the usability engineering then. yeah. consistency. yeah. so not how much n not how often it's used, but uh. yeah it does it doesn't really matter, but uh. okay, um. let's cut to the chase. okay, well le yeah. interface, yeah. technologies, uh. yeah. makes it possible to mm. not even necessary, because a lotta you can make a very sensitive microphone, so it makes it possible to uh just put it arou uh underneath it or on the on the bottom of the uh remote. yeah. right. but that's not import i think that's not im very important because yeah, it doesn't matter where the microphone is. ah okay, sure, okay, well tha underneath? indeed. it shouldn't be uh very uh visible. yeah sure, why no yeah but it doesn't makes it uh any more fancy because you get to see uh uh. yeah, okay. okay. well put it there. i don't mind. that doesn't doesn't really matter. okay. so? interface type. the l_c_d_ yeah, uh supplements well the supplement is to yeah. hey,. use the scroll. yeah i think so too. so why not, on on side. fast, yeah. so if you've got a settings, if you yes. you have a lot of options, because when you use yeah you get w when you use uh the settings menu for example to look up some uh uh some channels on your uh on your television, you should scroll scroll down uh on a menu which probably does not fit on your screen. so then it's uh very handy to to scroll down, you make just a rubber just like uh on your mouse or. just put it on the side and it's very easy to use. yeah, yeah. yeah. okay, what's the standard colour? i i you got you got different colours, but you should have a standard colour. black? with the with the yellow uh just a regular uh remote colour. and then have uh different covers uh to use. silver, yeah. you see a lot of t uh silver televisions. yeah y i think it's better to yeah th yeah. that's right. but if you use uh silver, uh rubber s silver rubber isn't fancy. when you use titanium, silver is fancy, but when you use silver rubber, it isn't fancy. silver has to shine, and rubber doesn't shine. especially when it's made of soft rubber like this. you understand? yeah. fruity. fruity loops. okay. you ping. well not what to do. not what to do. look. okay. thin i think we should work. thank you very much.
'kay. don't destroy my giraffe. drop it. bright colour. fancy colour. forward. you have to go t oh it's a side view. true. no no no no no. just looking. mm mm mm. next. it's true. p_ yeah, just a p_. where's where's the button for two? okay. doesn't matter. no. okay. okay, i'm going to tell you something about a trend watching. the trends from the past years, what the people like, what the youngsters like, what the elderly people liked about shapes, colours, material and stuff. 'kay. the method i used was like i told i watched the trends from the past years about colours, shapes, material they wanted uh from elderly and young people. so we can keep that in mind for designing f uh the device itself. findings i made. the most important thing people liked last year was that the remote control should be look look fancy. the second important thing that w should be if inv in innov innovative, okay, like the l_c_d_ screen that's quite innovative so that should be great meeting for this. and the third thing is it should be easy to use. i think with only one menu, four button, channel, volume, it should also be enough for easy to use. the personal preferences for the young people, they liked fruity colours like uh banana yellow, uh strawberry red and stuff. yeah. like that. the round shapes, and soft material m materials like the rubber. it should be soft uh i it should feeling spongy or s sponge bob like things. th elderly people like au colours which y are being seen in autumn like um woods um dark brown, red, deep reds and stuff. they liked square shapes with round edges. and hard materials like wood, um titanium. they those kind of materials they liked. this is a bit like the young peoples like the fruity colours, innovative, all the colours you see, the blue, the red, the white, the yellow, that stuff. and then i th i i personally thought the front side of the shape should be something for the youngsters like like this or something. it's it's a bit like a banana. and the colour should be yellow, or something. and for the elderly people just plain old. because we decided to have two kind of remotes, two designs, or was it two colours? different colours, yeah. we should decide whether it's going to be with round shapes. i think like my colleague, you said, is that's e better, or for the elderly people something like like the ipod or something, with round squares. simple but easy to use. so that's it. that is my yeah, like the older o older colours i can maybe yeah. colours th the elderly people uh look something like that. autumn colours like red, brown. they liked the wood a lot. so maybe we could give it like wooden loo look look or something in that colour. and a bit bit old school style renaissance, medieval kind of things. those kind of yeah, those kind of things. so you see the big difference between the young people? fresh, exciting. and the old people, old and boring. so sorry? yeah i think it's it's easier to do in colour than in shape. because otherwise we have to get different shapes, and colour way easier than yeah the shapes. in material yeah rubber, rubber is, like i said, young people like more soft materials and spongy ones and the old people like plain wood. so we have to decide if we're going to use real hard rubber, or soft rubber. or something something between that. yeah soft rubber which you can you can feel in it. or no. or or wh what's something harder. no no no but but you have to like like like a a eraser or something. that's the bit you can press it in, or something harder. yeah, something like this, yeah. yeah it's quite hard but you can press it in. it's feels kind s spongy. something. no. n n n are you going to invite sponge bob, maybe he can yeah i think that's the better thing to do. yeah w i think that l_c_d_ screen should be like yeah three quarter of the of the yeah the buttons won't get that small when the l_c_d_ screen is mm-hmm. larger i think. yeah becau because you have yeah okay, true, true, true true. yeah. yeah yeah yeah yeah. but it won't get that small because you have how much? nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen buttons on the screen. one to zero, the two digit, you have to you have to because some fat people with d thick fingers will press three buttons at same time. yeah true, but yeah, we have we have the zoom option, right? yeah. yeah. no. yeah. yeah. use a pen you you c you can lose the pen. yeah the fingers, yeah. yeah but that that can be with plain soft tissue. yeah, you can buy those at maybe it's better to to include rechargeable batteries which you can recharge through the docking station. so if the badg the batteries are dead then you can re you can uh change them. yeah yeah yeah like those. yep. yeah, normal plain you no normal plain batteries you can buy at the supermarket or retail shop. yeah. print plate. yeah yeah yeah. you always have a print plate. you always have a print plate, right? always, so i dunno what w what we have to decide about that. yeah, okay. but yeah okay, but the p print plate of l_ l_c_d_ screen is more advanced than a normal print plate, so that that's not of any discussion, i think. mm, i don't i dunno i don't think that's yeah yeah okay but i d i i don't know if nor o s it's quite a simple l_c_d_. yeah, it's quite a simple l_c_d_ screen. i think they don't need that big of c_p_u_. yeah, okay, true true. true. yeah. we have different colours. so the shapes is something between the square shapes with round colo corners and a round shapes? no i don't think, i think it's more round than square. so it meets i think it meets more the young people than the older people. yeah, that's our target. yeah. lower than forty years, i think it was. oh yeah that that i think i thought that was a quite good yeah. you can put it on your table with the l_c_d_ screen, you don't have to put it get it in your hand, you can put it next to you and then dive it in and. yeah. so you can't you you can't oh, you c you can draw it on your paper and then load it on the and load it on the the user the server. mm-hmm. yeah, you have to go back. yeah uh uh. isn't it better to have the sound and the general buttons horizontal? with the minus and the plus. i think it's easier than yeah. for sound and channel. yeah. i think it's it's easier to have it something like oh a button uh minus here, plus over here. a minus here, plus over here. and on here. the other buttons and on here the top. the options and then you have something like uh the p_ over here, and the sound. something uh something like sh plus minus plus uh minus. yeah i think you're going to s you're going to use it with one thumb. who's the usability engineering? she is. oh. um oh i have that those s numbers. or a good watch. b channel selection. per hour one hundred and sixty eight. volume selection four times an hour uh yeah, that depends on on on the remote. i think because i have two televisions at home. one is horizontal, one is vertical, so it depends. yeah. depends. yeah, lower. true. it's got to change. yeah is it is user interface. component. yeah i think it's it's easy for that, where are you, but then it says i'm here. yeah. yeah, a microphone, yeah. um i think where it isn't seen the most. inside. yeah. i i between the round of the r_. yeah. yeah, okay. yeah. yeah bu but i think the left s under corner should be the best. where isn't i it isn't most in sight. i think. no. actually doesn't. i think i thought the, like you said, like scroll next to the remote isn't that handy. i think it's better to just up what you'd like to do on the screen. if you want to go back you have to back button go back, if you want to choose audio settings you press audio settings and it goes to that s sub-menu. yeah?
