so, hello everyone. we're here to have a kick-off meeting for the design of a f for the beginning of new project um uh remote control for the design for a new remote control. i'm the project manager christa pavlov and okay let's begin. so i'm first going to do an opening then we get used to one anothers and we speak about this tool we're going to design and try to make a project plan, some discussion and then we talk of uh the next meeting. so um we want to to do a new remote control. it has to be original, trendy and user friendly. um i think the important points we have to t talk about are uh it's functional design, it's conceptual design, and desail detailed design. and for that we're going um all to work individually and then have meeting during the whole day. um, so let's try the whiteboard. um so any of you who want to go. wow. a rabbit. a rabbit. you want to go? a human ah. mm i think you're supposed to, yeah. hmm. is that a worm? or uh yeah christa pavlov mm. smiling fish. mm-hmm. yeah. next. let's talk about money. so. yeah, mm that's the price we want to that's the aim for the price for the remote control. we aim to do this profit. yeah. mm-hmm. mm for a production cost of mm twelve fifty euros maximum. 'kay. so any of you have experience in remote controls? that so that could be a great um application. remote controls children proof. mm mm-hmm. okay. so they have to be waterproof maybe? 'cause they eat she ate it. mm-hmm. mm-hmm. colourful, yeah mm. no, that's a good idea. mm mm-mm. yeah. no, because you think, why not. mm-hmm. good idea. small also? don't you think no uh, not too much buttons or mm. mm-hmm. yeah, that's okay. so, i think there's so you you think it's better if small than bigger. no, not too small, yeah. hmm. okay. mm. mm-hmm. mm. so, some kind of idea uh with um um cellular phone with a a screen that will tell you what no. okay. and too expensive. mm. mm-mm. mm-hmm. mm mm mm. so adaptable yeah something yeah. three option. um. mm-hmm. maybe if it's more, if there is a software inside that ask you three hmm. if it if we want a r universal remote control that we sa like we say before it may may need more than three mm three button, three mm possibilities, ye yeah. mm. yeah. i change channel like this, m uh i want to go to twenty five, and then to ten, uh-huh mm yeah. also we can be here yeah, that would be cool. mm yeah. mm-mm. okay. so i think we have full of idea. um we're going to meet again in thirty minutes and uh i want you to mm work on these ideas and try to make a uh the ones, make um to decide what what are the ones important and what are the one that we don't want. and um m maybe more in the technical parts what uh do we want to do. um. so um your personal coach will send you some instruction for for this thirty minutes. mm. mm-hmm. mm okay. so. i think that's all. yeah. see you in thirty minutes.
oops. yeah, for favourite animals. it's gonna be not my favourite one but the one i can draw. and it's gonna be you'll try to guess. no. yes, that's a rabbit. that's my favourite one. that's it. hmm. wow. no. wow. that's cobra. no, it just small cobra, yeah. it's co c quite recognisable. christa christa. hmm. okay. just tr try to guess who is a user interface designer. according to the drawings. okay. on the international market. wow. mm. to eat? children proof. hmm. okay, unbreakable. uh-huh. colourful? that's not practical. no. but how gonna okay, just uh but it's uh monochrome it's n it's not like otherwise you will never find it. cool. ch yeah, but without any extremes like n not of this size, not too large. okay. yeah, like a palm sized. just to hold it. no, no screens, it's too complex. and n maybe not too expensive, well it's not my problem, but well okay. but no screens on remote controls. mm-hmm. mm-hmm, mm-hmm. adaptable. alright, good, so how many actions do we need to implement in it? on off? i mean if it's less than three uh then we can make it uh like a like three mental states, yeah you know what i mean, we can just make it uh controlled by a brain, huh? mm-hmm. sh sure, sure. but for standard actions you usually what do you do, you change channels, you adjust volume, and nothing else. mm-hmm. you do this? i usually just change channels. uh-huh. go back button is good. i once had it. mm-hmm. history. market expert. okay. thank you everybody.
no. rabbit. you wa is the white okay. i guess you can. yeah uh not really. small cobra. chris. mm. smile fish. yeah. yeah, you're hmm. yeah, we're to sell two million then. mm yeah. yeah, pret yeah. ah. yeah, we have some child lock or something, yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah, it's always black or yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah even we can change colours, no? like the uh like the phones and these things we c yeah. at least for children like one colour and. and it should be really small and. huh not so big like yeah. yeah, not too much buttons and uh. yeah. yeah. colour, size, sh yeah, maybe at least n not bigger than this i guess. yeah yeah, at least it should hold in your hand n properly, like. yeah. uh maybe we can change the colours that at least the frame. mm. s so then it depends you are to mm i mean you c you can easily remove the frame. yeah, yeah. yeah. yeah. mm. too expensive, yeah. ye yeah. hmm. i mean it it's like it's like two types no? people are right handed or left handed so y because i am left handed i use like this, say if you're right handed you use like this or so tha your switch on and off should be on yeah. mm huh. maybe i think even we can keep two switches and then we can uh only make one working. we can adapt only one switch, suppose here like we can make two switches and if i'm left-hander i use this switch to follow the main operations. two. yeah. yeah. mm yeah. yeah. mm. yeah. yeah. yeah. but they keep generally their t slash slash uh this thing and then the dash dash and then you can put yeah, you can only have one bit. dash. yeah you can yeah. yeah. yeah yeah, the previous button is. uh, okay. oh uh. uh. yeah. yeah yeah, what the which channels the viewer marketing yeah. thank you.
wow. wow. complex. huh? a cat. no. darn. uh. a what? a r a rabbit, oh oh yeah, where is the carrot? okay mm-hmm. i am not very good at uh this kind of stuff. my favourite animal is guess. a human, yay. it's a very complex animal and um yeah. characteristics of this this animal is dangerous. ah, a kind of uh snake? cobra? exactly. uh-huh. what about you uh christa? a fish. a smiling fish. mm-hmm. so, w whiteboard is working? good. next. yeah, well. not me. so. twenty five euro for a remote control. okay. 'tis big number. mm-hmm. uh yes, we have plenty at home. in fact, my daughter likes l remote controls. to eat? yeah, mainly, and to break. mm-hmm. yeah. ye ye yeah. so she likes uh buttons which make click, so it has to click. it has to be uh wha baby proof yeah but mainly it has to be very robust because even if she's not very tall she's uh high enough so that uh when she throw it away it's uh so it has to be very robust. unbreakable, yeah. mm-hmm. and uh it has to be nice looking, colourful, maybe colourful, because uh nobody has colourful remote control, they're always black, yeah, but this one could be i dunno, purple or b yeah, yeah. one colour. yeah, yeah. oh like the phones, yeah, it could change colours, yeah. yeah. good. should it be, y you know these uh remote controls where um they are what they call a universal ret remote control so y you can decide that now it's the remote control for the television, then it's the remote control for the the sound system, or for your refrigerator whatever i dunno if it's or if we should have a targeted re remote control. so colour, robustness, easy to use, size, yeah, size matters, yeah. mm. yeah. mm. but uh what would be different from this, from the others? i dunno if yeah, at least the colour would be different. i think one thing important for instance in this remote control if you remember when people use it they're they never find a good button in the right place. for some reason they they they click the off button when they want to use the so there's a problem in the design of that kind of remote control somehow, i dunno. too expensive for twelve euro? ah. mm-hmm. i thought it could be only a screen which would change depending on uh uh the use or even the user. so ma i prefer to have the off button at the top right, so i would have my own design of the remote control because it's in fact just a a full touch screen remote control, if you if you like. i don't know if it makes sense, but yeah, for instance, mm. mm. maybe, if if it's possible, yeah. yeah. three buttons you mean? ah. mm-hmm, yeah, sure. yeah, more than three actions that you may want to do at a given time. yeah but for instance when you change channels you can have you can just go to the next one or go to channel twenty five. and that's already more complex to go to channel twenty five. uh no. because i'm only using three or four channels but and then back to the one i was before, so there's whichever it was. yeah. uh uh we had that in in other countries. yeah e even the history so you could like uh undo previous of the previous. then you can watch what your ah you could also record your record your sequence of actions, that becomes more complex, but you could look at what uh the other people have used there or remote controls. yeah maybe it's a okay. so what does m_e_ means? m_e_ the user requirements? or that's uh that's for us? uh that's me. oh, of course yeah, the user requirement specifications, uh-huh, yeah. okay. i'll think of that. so? meeting's over? great. thank you.
